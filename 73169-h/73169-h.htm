<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty Wales</span> and her friends appeared first
in “Betty Wales, Freshman,” which told the
story of their freshman year at Harding College.
Eleanor Watson was in that group; so
were Mary Brooks, Helen Adams, Roberta,
the three B’s, and Katharine Kittredge, of Kankakee.
Madeline Ayres made her entrance
in “Betty Wales, Sophomore.” “Betty Wales,
Junior,” and “Betty Wales, Senior” completed
the undergraduate history of Betty’s
class. “Betty Wales, B. A.” is the story of a
summer abroad, where Betty met Mr. Morton,
and “Babe” met his son. “Betty Wales &amp;
Co.” described the beginnings of the famous
Tally-ho Tea-Shop, and “Betty Wales on the
Campus” brought Betty back to Harding as
the Secretary of the Student’s Aid Committee.
She lived in Morton Hall, erected by the testy
old millionaire because Betty’s work had won
his sympathy and interest.</p>

<p>The “ploshkin” referred to in this story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
was at first a fascinatingly impossible little
animal in a story that Eugenia Ford told
Betty’s Smallest Sister, but Madeline Ayres
saw its wide possibilities as a fun-maker, and
Jasper J. Morton helped the girls put images
of it on the market.</p>

<p class="ph2">Betty Wales Decides</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>A SLUMP IN PLOSHKINS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a breathless August afternoon. Betty
Wales, very crisp and cool in white linen, sat
in a big wicker chair on the broad piazza
of the family cottage at Lakeside. On the
wicker table beside her were a big basket of
family mending, a new novel, and an uncut
magazine. In her lap was a fuzzy gray
kitten. Betty Wales was deliberately ignoring
the mending; she had been “perfectly
crazy” to begin the new novel, but now she
ignored that likewise; she had entirely forgotten
the fuzzy gray kitten. She was busily
engaged in the altogether delectable occupation,
for a hot August afternoon, of doing
nothing at all.</p>

<p>Jim Watson,—Eleanor’s brother, you remember,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
and the architect in charge of Morton
Hall, also a warm admirer of Morton
Hall’s pretty little manager,—had been in
Cleveland for a week “on business.” The
business was connected with two big houses
that his firm were building there. It had left
all his evenings and most of his afternoons
wholly at the disposal of the Wales’s family
cook, alias the pretty little manager of Morton
Hall. The cook had rushed through her work
in a scandalous fashion that caused the Wales
family to indulge in many loud complaints of
too-early breakfasts, “snippy” lunches, and
wildly extravagant dinners—Jim always got
out to Lakeside in plenty of time for the
dinners. He had left for New York the night
before, after the very most elaborate and delicious
dinner of them all, and the Wales’s
family cook was tired, though she did not
know it, and happy, in spite of a queer lonely
sensation that was hopelessly mixed with relief
at having a long, lazy afternoon all to herself,
to spend with a kitten for company, a book for
diversion, and plenty of mending in case the
unwonted joys of idleness should pall.</p>

<p>At four, when the postman came by on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
afternoon round, Betty was still staring absently
off at the blue lake, thinking vague,
happy thoughts. She was so absorbed that
she never even saw the postman, who obligingly
walked across the piazza to her corner
and dropped the afternoon mail in her lap,
right on top of the gray kitten, who was too
sleepy to care.</p>

<p>Just one letter, and it was for Miss B.
Wales, the address typewritten, the name of
Jasper J. Morton’s world-famous banking
house in a corner of the envelope. It was
from one of Mr. Morton’s secretaries,—not the
Harding graduate that Betty had sent him,
but an energetic young man who had been
with the firm for several years. It was he
to whom Mr. Morton had delegated the task
of marketing ploshkins in New York and
elsewhere, and he and Betty had become quite
friendly over the checks and reorders and
other business arrangements.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I regret to state,” he wrote now, “that
the ploshkin market has slumped. Our regular
customers all report that they are ‘stuck,’
to use a technical expression of commerce,
with the ploshkins they already have on hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
that the demand has entirely dropped off, and
that they do not anticipate a revival of it.</p>

<p>“Mr. Morton has asked me to communicate
with you, expressing his regret at the sudden
termination of so profitable a business. (You
will be amused, I know, to hear that the first
thing he said was, ‘My, but that relieves my
mind. It always worried me to think of
people wanting to waste their money on those
silly old splashers.’)</p>

<p>“Fortunately the spring sales used up practically
all the stock you had on hand, so there
will be no losses to meet. But there will also,
I fear, be no more profits.</p>

<p>“Mr. Morton respectfully suggests that the
ingenious young lady whose name he is unable
to recall shall coöperate with you in inventing
a new specialty. ‘Most anything
will do if it’s only silly enough,’ in Mr. Morton’s
opinion; and he will gladly arrange to
market the product as he has the ploshkins.</p>

<p>“Hoping anxiously for such a renewal of
our business relations, I remain,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Most respectfully,</span><br>

“<span class="smcap">Samuel Stone</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Betty laughed heartily, all by herself, over
Mr. Morton’s characteristic remarks. It was
fortunate, she reflected, that when he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
cross he was always comical. Otherwise she
would never have made friends with him in
Europe, and then he would never have built
Morton Hall at Harding to please her, nor
helped the Tally-ho Tea-Shop out of its very
worst trouble,—nor sold the ploshkins. She
smiled all to herself at Mr. Samuel Stone’s
“anxious hopes,” and frowned as she contemplated
the utter impossibility of making the
ingenious young lady (named Madeline Ayres)
invent a new “specialty” except by some such
happy accident as had produced the ploshkin,
that comically sad little creature, with an
“ingrowing face” that smiled, a prickly,
slippery tail, and one wing to hide behind,
plaster images of which had been circulated,
by the energy and enterprise of Jasper J.
Morton and Samuel Stone, from New York to
San Francisco, if not further.</p>

<p>And having laughed and smiled and
frowned, Betty read the letter all through
again, sat up straight in her big easy chair,
and, choosing one of Will’s stockings, began
to darn the very biggest hole in it. She
wanted to think hard, and she could always
think harder when her fingers were busy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>A slump in the ploshkin market meant no
more ploshkin income. When she considered
staying at home for the winter, Betty had
counted on that hitherto prolific source of
revenue to keep Dorothy on at Miss Dick’s, as
well as to provide herself with necessary pin-money.
Father wanted her to stay at home,
but Betty wondered sadly if he realized how
much she would cost! A girl doesn’t know
about that until she has tried living on her
earnings. Betty Wales understood just how
fast little things will count up, try as you may
to be careful. Father wasn’t yet back on
Easy Street; Will had made a bad joke to the
effect that Easy Street was certainly Hard
Street when it came to getting a place on it
again after you had carelessly slipped off.</p>

<p>“That’s true as well as funny,” Betty reflected
sadly, “and the reason is that people
who have been rich don’t know how to be
poor. We’re still an extravagant family, no
matter how hard we try to save. So I almost
think—oh dear! I wonder if they do miss
me much at home when I’m away! Because
President Wallace is sure that Morton Hall
will miss me if I don’t go back to it. I wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
if he’s right. I almost think—— Goodness,
I should hate to seem conceited about it,
because I know as well as anything that it’s
perfect nonsense the way they all think I can
do things that other people can’t. Anybody
could do anything that I’ve ever done,—if
they’d only try,” ended Betty Wales, with a
fine disregard for antecedents and a serene
lack of appreciation of the rarity of people
who try—and who keep on trying to the bitter
end.</p>

<p>If Dorothy didn’t go back to Miss Dick’s
there would be two extra ones at home; that
would put boarding, with five in the family,
out of the question, and rents in town were
frightfully expensive. It did seem as if a
person who had a good salary waiting for her
in Harding would better “go back on the
job,” as Will would have put it.</p>

<p>A big, snorting motor-car slewed round a
corner, with a silvery peal of its “gabriel,”
glided swiftly down the street, and drew up
with a lurch in front of the Wales cottage.
Betty, her eyes on Will’s stocking, her
thoughts working hard on the perplexing
Harding-or-no-Harding problem, gave a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
start at discovering that she was going to have
callers. By the time she had dropped the
stocking and carefully arranged the kitten in
a comfortable little furry ball on a hammock
cushion, the two ladies in the tonneau of the
car had shed their protecting goggles, hoods,
veils, and ulsters, and started up the path to
the door.</p>

<p>“Nobody I know,” reflected Betty, going
forward hospitably to meet them. They were
both young-more likely to be Nan’s friends
than Mother’s, and Nan was off spending a
week with Ethel Hale Eaton. Looking more
closely Betty decided that they must have
mistaken the house; the pretty, overdressed
girl with the huge plumed hat, and the more
subdued young woman in a wonderful silk
gown and a close-fitting toque, both in the very
latest style, did not look quite like friends of
Nan or indeed of any of the Wales family.</p>

<p>The girl was ahead as they came up the
steps. “Is Miss Wales at home?” she asked
in a sweet, assured voice, smiling a dazzling
smile from beneath the big drooping plumes.</p>

<p>“Do you mean the real Miss Wales-my
sister Nan?” Betty asked. “She’s away paying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
some visits. I’m Betty, the next youngest.
Won’t you sit down a moment?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, yes,” the older woman, with the
sweet, subdued face and manner answered.
“And it ain’t your sister we want. It’s you.
I’m Mrs. James O’Toole, of Paris, France, and
that’s my girl Marie.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to meet you both,” Betty
stammered. “That is,—I haven’t met you
before, have I? I have such a bad memory.”</p>

<p>“No, you haven’t met us,” Miss Marie
O’Toole told her with an amused giggle.
“If you had, you’d remember. Even people
with bad memories don’t forget Ma and me.”</p>

<p>“No?” Betty laughed back at her in
friendly fashion. In spite of the plumes, too
much jewelry, and an absurdly hobbled
skirt, there was something very winning
about Miss Marie O’Toole, with her pretty
doll face and her sweet, thrilling voice. But
Mrs. O’Toole was a curiosity. Betty had had
to try hard not to jump when the demure
little lady, dressed with such exquisite elegance,
had opened her mouth and been suddenly
transformed into a very ordinary person
with a dreadful twang in her voice and a shocking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
lack of grammar in her conversation.
She listened in blank silence to her daughter’s
comment, and then handed Betty a card.</p>

<p>“That’s to interduce us. Has the letter
followed?”</p>

<p>Betty stared in bewilderment. The card
was President Wallace’s, introducing Mrs. and
Miss O’Toole. “Letter will follow” was written
after the names.</p>

<p>“Oh,” exclaimed Betty comprehendingly,
“you are friends of President Wallace’s, and
he is going to write me about—something.
I’m very glad to meet any friends of his.
Isn’t he splendid?”</p>

<p>“I think he’s a cross old bear,” returned
Miss Marie O’Toole sweetly, “and Ma thinks
he hasn’t ordinary common sense, don’t you,
Ma?”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that,” said Mrs. O’Toole
sharply. “But we ain’t any friends of his.
The letter to follow is about Marie entering
the college. I told you we had ought to have
waited a while, Marie, for that there letter.”</p>

<p>Marie smiled blandly. “Oh, I don’t know.
I guess we’re capable of explaining ourselves
to Miss Wales.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“I’m sure you are,” agreed Betty hastily.
She was bursting with suppressed curiosity.</p>

<p>“Well,” began Mrs. O’Toole, “it’s like this.
Marie wants to go to college. I can’t think
why, but she does. She met some swell New
York girls in Paris last winter, and they told
her that it was all the rage. Of course,”
added Mrs. O’Toole magnificently, “we know
all the elect of the American colony.”</p>

<p>“She means élite,” explained Miss Marie
with a giggle. “Hurry up, Ma, and get to
the point of your story.”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Toole sighed a patient, long-suffering
sigh and continued. “So when we came
across in June, Marie went right up to Harding
and took the exams, and she failed in
most of ’em. So then she was more sot than
ever on her idee, and she hired a teacher to
travel with us all summer—a girl that this
President Wallace recommended. And last
week she tried again and done better, but not
good enough to suit.”</p>

<p>“The tutor was so tiresome,” explained
Miss Marie with asperity. “She told me
that I couldn’t possibly pass, so of course I
couldn’t. Go on, Ma.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“So then she was still more sot to go,” went
on Mrs. O’Toole, “and she sent her Pa a
tellergram and he——”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell that part,” broke in her
daughter hastily. “Don’t you remember
that he said not to—President Wallace, I
mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, nothing come of it,” said
Mrs. O’Toole wearily. “But he finally sent
us here, to say that if you’d undertake Marie
she could come, otherwise not. She’ll be terrible
disappointed if you won’t,” ended Mrs.
O’Toole, “and if you will she’s willing to pay
quite regardless.”</p>

<p>Marie giggled nervously. “That sounds as
if I was buying a hat, Ma, or an invitation to
an exclusive ball. President Wallace said
that money was no object to Miss Wales.”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Toole glanced sharply at the little
cottage and then at the perfectly plain white
dress that Betty was wearing, with its marked
contrast to Marie’s furbelows. “Money is
something of an object to any sensible person—except
some college presidents,” she added
pointedly.</p>

<p>Miss Marie O’Toole turned to Betty with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
pleading smile on her pretty face. “I guess
you understand what I mean,” she said, “and
please do say that you’ll ‘undertake’ me.”</p>

<p>Betty looked perplexedly from one to the
other. “But what am I to do?” she asked.
“I don’t understand what you mean by that
word.”</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Mrs. O’Toole triumphantly.
“I told you we had ought to have
waited for the letter.”</p>

<p>Miss Marie shrugged her shoulders impatiently,
and turned to Betty. “President Wallace
said that he was willing, under the circumstances——”
Marie hesitated. “I suppose
he meant my being educated mostly in a
convent, where they don’t prepare girls for college,
and being so ‘sot’ on coming, and so on.
Anyway he said that under the circumstances
he was willing for me to enter with one more
condition than is strictly according to rules,
if you would promise to tutor me as you did
another girl once, and to look after me generally,
and explain things that I don’t know
about. He said he thought I would find a
lot of things at college that I didn’t know
about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>There was a long pause. Of all the embarrassing
situations, Betty thought, this was the
worst. President Wallace was—it would be
very disrespectful to say what. Besides,
Betty realized in spite of her annoyance that
President Wallace undoubtedly had had a
good reason for sending the O’Tooles out to
spoil her lazy afternoon. Part of the reason
was probably because he had had to send them
somewhere, or he would have them still pleading
with him to reconsider his decision.
Betty foresaw that Marie, being “sot,” would
not give up easily; while Mrs. O’Toole, wanting
Marie to have what she wanted, would be
equally persistent. Betty decided that she
needed a breathing space.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to say,” she told them.
“To begin with, I haven’t fully decided to
go back to Harding this winter. If I do go,
I shall be very, very busy with my regular
work. I don’t really see how I can do more
than I have already arranged for. But before
I decide, I must wait for President Wallace’s
letter. It may be about you, or it may be
partly about Morton Hall—the dormitory
that I shall have charge of if I go back. May<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
I have a little time to consider? I really
couldn’t say anything but no, if I had to decide
to-day.”</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Toole sighed and looked reproachfully
at Marie. “I told you so,” she complained.
“You’re always in too much of a
hurry. We might just as well have taken
things easy and enjoyed the ride. We came
all the way in our car, Miss Wales.”</p>

<p>“But I like to ride fast,” announced her
daughter calmly. “Do you, Miss Wales?
Because, if we’re going to wait around here
for that letter, I’ll take you for a ride. Do
many Harding girls have their own cars?”</p>

<p>Just then Tom Benson appeared on the
piazza. Betty presented him, and Marie
promptly dazzled him with her smile and
bore him off to a distant corner of the piazza.</p>

<p>As soon as she was out of ear-shot, Mrs.
O’Toole leaned forward in her chair and addressed
Betty earnestly. “Do it if you possibly
can,” she begged. “It’s a foolish notion
she’s got that she wants to go to college, but
there ain’t anything bad about it. It ain’t as
if she wanted to go on the stage, or ride bareback
in a circus, or marry some good-for-nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
fellow that wants her for her money. So
I’m awful anxious for her to have her way.
You see, Miss Wales, I know I stand in her light
some. I know I ain’t a lady, though I do dress
perfect,” she added proudly, “and look so
young that people are always asking Marie
about her pretty older sister. But looks and
money ain’t everything, Miss Wales. And
Marie is always so awful nice to me and her
Pa, that we aim to suit her as well as we can.”</p>

<p>“Did Mr. O’Toole come to America too?”
asked Betty, for want of anything better to
say. She couldn’t help being touched by
Mrs. O’Toole’s plea, but she didn’t want Mrs.
O’Toole to know it yet.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s always in America,” explained
Mrs. O’Toole, “out at the mine, you know.
But that’s no place for Marie, and her Pa
knows it. He wants her to have all the benefits
fits of education and foreign travel. We
ought to be going, Miss Wales. Day after to-morrow,
did you say? All right. You’ve
been awful kind, Miss Wales. Come, Marie,
we must be going.”</p>

<p>Marie came, slowly and reluctantly, with a
backward smile for Tom Benson, and a murmured,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
“To-morrow afternoon then, and we’re
staying in town at that big hotel with the
queer German name.”</p>

<p>Betty watched them go as she might have
watched the curtain dropping on the last
scene of a tragi-comical play. Tom Benson
broke into her revery with a laughing comment.</p>

<p>“Your friend Miss O’Toole is an accomplished
little flirt, all right,” he announced.</p>

<p>“She isn’t my friend,” Betty told him
severely, “and it takes two to flirt, Tom Benson.
So, as a favor to me, you’re not to call
on her in town. You can come over here and
see her day after to-morrow if you want to.
It looks to me as if I had been tumbled into
the job of chaperoning her through the first
half of her freshman year at Harding, so I
propose to start her out right.”</p>

<p>“Why the first half of the freshman year
only?” demanded Tom curiously.</p>

<p>“Because,” explained Betty, “mid-years
come then—at Harding. Seems to me I have
heard that they come about the same time at
Yale, but I suppose they don’t worry a distinguished
scholar like you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“The fair Marie doesn’t act particularly
studious,” admitted Tom. “But you can’t
ever tell about these pretty college girls.”
Tom smiled meaningly at Betty, for whose
brains he professed a vast admiration.</p>

<p>“Well, I wasn’t flunked out at freshman
mid-years,” Betty told him, “but if I didn’t
think Miss Marie O’Toole would find half a
year of Harding all she wants, for one reason
or another, I certainly shouldn’t be contemplating
acting as her special tutor.”</p>

<p>“Are you considering it?” demanded Tom
in amazement.</p>

<p>Betty nodded calmly.</p>

<p>Tom whistled. “Then I bet you have your
hands full.”</p>

<p>“Well, I certainly hate having them empty,”
returned Betty, beginning again on the stockings.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>MONTANA MARIE O’TOOLE DAWNS UPON
HARDING COLLEGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty Wales</span> always insisted that the
O’Tooles’ visit had nothing whatever to do
with her decision to go back to Harding.</p>

<p>“I see through you, Mademoiselle,” Will
teased her. “You think you’ll be getting
ready to be married about next year, and
you’re taking your last chance to say a long
farewell to your beloved Harding,—also to
save your three-decker, secretary-tutor-tea-shop
salary for a grand and elegant trousseau.”</p>

<p>“Will Wales——” began Betty fiercely, and
then relapsed into haughty silence (accompanied
by the faintest blush) as the only proper
treatment of such unfounded accusations.</p>

<p>Nan was amused, and Dorothy relieved, of
course, that her favorite sister was to be within
call again. At first Mr. Wales agreed, rather
soberly, that it would be foolish to neglect such
good opportunities; but before she left home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Betty had made him laugh so heartily at a
few of her pet business theories, mostly
adapted from Mary Brooks Hinsdale’s Rules for
the Perfect Tea-Shop, that he accepted her decision
as a huge joke—just another of Betty’s
whims, having no painful connection with the
ebb of the family fortunes.</p>

<p>But Mother, with the illogical perversity
that is proverbially feminine, took the amazing
position, for her, of Marie O’Toole’s ardent
defender and champion.</p>

<p>“If you’re not going back chiefly on that
poor child’s account,” she told her daughter
Betty, “why, I’m ashamed of your unsympathetic
nature. I never was so sorry for any
one”—she had been present on the occasion of
the O’Tooles’ second call. “She’s so sweet
and pretty,—and so ignorant of all the things
that other sweet, pretty girls learn from their
mothers. She must know how strangely Mrs.
O’Toole strikes nice people, but she doesn’t
act annoyed or embarrassed, or try to keep her
mother from making those dreadful remarks.
Mrs. O’Toole says that they have never been
separated, and that she doesn’t know how she
can live next winter without Marie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Betty thinks they can safely prepare for
a grand family reunion after mid-years,”
laughed Will.</p>

<p>“And then,” explained Betty practically,
“I can have time enough to do justice to Morton
Hall and”—very mysteriously—“to a
lovely new plan that I have for the Tally-ho.
Of course, as long as I’m going back anyhow,
I won’t be mean enough not to ‘undertake’
Marie. But I hate having a lot of entirely
different things to be responsible for, and I
specially hate tutoring. I only hope this girl
won’t cry all the time the way Eugenia Ford
used to. It was fearfully embarrassing.”</p>

<p>“Tom Benson advises you to make her join
an anti-flirt society first off,” Will put in
solemnly. “He says it’s lucky Harding
isn’t a co-educational college, because in that
case it would take about two able-bodied
chaperons to look after the gay Miss
O’Toole.”</p>

<p>“Tell Tom Benson from me that I’m glad
he’s at Yale instead of Winstead,” Betty retorted
loftily. “A girl who wants to go to
Harding badly enough to study all summer,
take two sets of exams, and enter with three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
conditions hanging over her, isn’t as silly as
Tom Benson seems to think.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” Mother defended her
oddly-chosen favorite. “President Wallace
must have seen her possibilities, or he wouldn’t
have asked Betty to help her out. He evidently
feels just as I do about her. I am sure
that she has a naturally fine mind, and that
she will respond very quickly to the cultivated
atmosphere of the college. I doubt if
Betty will need to do more than give her the
most casual sort of instruction.”</p>

<p>Betty smiled to herself in the sheltering
darkness of the piazza, where the family was
spending the evening. Her private opinion
coincided closely with Tom Benson’s, to the
effect that even without the complications of
co-education, Marie would be “a handful.”
But President Wallace had hinted that he had
a good reason which he was “not yet at liberty
to communicate” for asking Betty to try to
get Marie creditably through her freshman
year; and, as Betty put it briefly to herself, it
would be mean, just because it meant hard
work, to refuse to do what the tragi-comical
O’Tooles had set their hearts on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>So that matter was settled. The Students’
Aid work had developed so rapidly that Betty
had petitioned for a senior assistant, and also,
to the vast amusement of the Association’s
managers, for a smaller salary for herself.
Betty was bent on securing enough leisure to
carry out her “lovely new plan” for the
Tally-ho. Jim Watson may have had something
to do with her feeling, or he may not; but,
for one reason or another, Betty had what Madeline
Ayres called a “leading” that this would
be her last chance at Harding; and she wanted
to “finish out” the Tally-ho, partly because
she wished Mr. Morton to feel fully justified in
his purchase and improvement of the property,
but chiefly just to satisfy her own queer little
sense of the fitness of things. The Tally-ho
was capable of more than had ever yet been developed;
and Betty liked people and institutions
to do their very most and best. But the details
of all this planning were kept a grand secret,
even from the Smallest Sister, who had been
the “Co.” in the Betty Wales business firm.
Betty wanted to look over the situation at
Harding first; then she would be ready to confide
her conclusions to Co., Babbie and Madeline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Betty Wales went back to Harding three
days before the college opened, in order to get
a good start with her work. But almost before
she had stepped off the train she found
herself up to her neck in a deluge of Students’
Aid affairs, all marked “immediate,” at least
in the minds of the persons most concerned.
It was a large factor in Betty’s success that she
could always get the other person’s point of
view; but there are occasions when this trait
makes its possessor very uncomfortable. Betty
wanted every girl who had applied for the
Association’s help to get it, if she was worthy;
she wanted every lonely freshman to be met at
her train, every boarding-house keeper in
search of waitresses, and every well-to-do student
who hated to do her own mending, to feel
that nobody could supply their varied wants so
well as the Students’ Aid. The result was
that one small secretary was shamefully overworked,
almost forgot that she was supposed
to be helping to run the most successful tea-room
in Harding, and had no time to spend
in worry over the probable bothers connected
with tutoring Miss Marie O’Toole.</p>

<p>President Wallace was of course infinitely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
busier than Betty; all he had found time to do
about Marie was to tell Betty, with a twinkle,
that he had perfect confidence in her ability
to manage “even the extraordinary product of
a mining camp, a convent in Utah, a Select
School for Wealthy American Girls in Paris,
and the companionship of Mrs. James O’Toole;
and to transform said product into a freshman
that should be a real credit to Harding College.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Betty had gasped at the complicated
things that were expected of her,
laughed because President Wallace was laughing
and seemed to expect that of her too, and
then hurried off to find Miss Ferris and ask
her if Mary Jones, the senior who lived in an
attic at the other end of High Street, couldn’t
somehow be persuaded to pocket her pride and
come to fill an unexpected vacancy in Morton
Hall.</p>

<p>She painstakingly met the train that Marie
had written she would take; though either
Marie had missed that train or Betty missed
Marie. But with the capable assistance of
Mary Brooks Hinsdale and Helen Adams she
found Rachel and Christy, and Georgia Ames<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
and Eugenia Ford found her. And the six of
them, declaring that she looked tired to death
and almost, if not quite, starved, bore her off
to the Tally-ho for refreshment.</p>

<p>“Which is the biggest, most comfy chair
you’ve got, Nora?” demanded Mary. “Bring
us tea and the best little cakes you have for
seven.”</p>

<p>“Better make it for fourteen, Nora,”
amended Georgia. “I’m fairly hungry.”</p>

<p>And while the seven ate for fourteen, they
all talked at once of “wonderful” vacations,
“dandy” trips, “thrilling” summer adventures,
each story ending with a rapturous,
“And now aren’t we having a grand time
here?”</p>

<p>“I must go and find that freshman,” Betty
declared at last. She had said the same thing
before, but this time she meant it.</p>

<p>“No, you mustn’t,” Georgia told her firmly,
tumbling little Eugenia into her lap as a precaution
against sudden flight. “You must
tell me where she boards, and I’ll go and dry
her tears, help her to unpack, explain about
morning chapel and freshman class assembly,
and tell her to meet you in—let me see—oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
the note-room in the basement of College
Hall, at eleven o’clock sharp. She’s sure to
be through by that time, and if you’re busy
then, why, she can just wait for you.”</p>

<p>Betty listened to Georgia’s program in obvious
relief. “Oh, Georgia, would you really
do all that? You’re an angel! With so many
other things on my mind, having to hunt her
up seems like the very last straw. But
Georgia—she’s—rather queer—not like other
girls, I mean. She’s lived abroad a lot and
her mother is—peculiar.” Betty tried to
forewarn Georgia without prejudicing the
company against the absent Marie.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, dear,” Mary Brooks
Hinsdale reassured her. “Georgia will manage
your freshman. Miss Ames, I hereby rechristen
you Georgia-to-the-Rescue, and elect
you to take extra-special care of our precious
Betty Wales.”</p>

<p>Georgia blushed very red at being praised
and “elected” to a mission by the charming
Mrs. Hinsdale. “I don’t care how queer
Miss O’Toole is,” she declared stoutly. “I
guess I can make her understand a few
simple messages. I’ve wanted to see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
inside of that elegant new freshman hotel-affair
where she’s staying. Go to bed early,
and get rested, Betty dear.”</p>

<p>When the college clock began to strike
eleven the next morning Betty reached for
her rain-coat—the freshman downpour had
duly arrived—to run over to College Hall and
keep her appointment with Marie. But she
had pulled on one sleeve, when Miss Ferris
appeared to say that she had interviewed
Mary Jones, who lived at the other end of
High Street, and had persuaded her—it took
fifteen minutes to tell what. Just outside
Betty’s door Miss Ferris encountered Georgia
Ames, red and panting. Georgia skilfully
avoided a collision, slipped inside Betty’s
office before the door had fairly closed upon
the departing Miss Ferris, and dropped,
breathless, into a chair.</p>

<p>“I thought maybe you’d forgotten your
freshman,” she panted. “So I came to remind
you. Don’t know why I hurried so.
Only—she is entertaining the whole note-room,
and it’s full of girls, and she is just
screamingly funny, Betty, though I shouldn’t
say so to any one else. But some of the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
girls will pass on her choice remarks—the
grind book will be full of her. And I couldn’t
help liking her last night, so I thought I’d
better come and remind you.” Georgia
paused awkwardly.</p>

<p>“You know she just happens to be my
freshman,” Betty explained smilingly. “I
was asked to tutor her and look out for her a
little. I liked her too, the little I’ve seen of
her.” Betty had slipped on her rain-coat
while they talked. “Come and help me find
her, Georgia-dear-to-the-Rescue.”</p>

<p>The note-room is a notable Harding institution,
time-honored and hedged about with
inviolable customs. It gets its name from
the four letter-racks, one for each class, that
cover the long wall opposite the windows.
The other walls are patched with Lost and
Found and Want signs, and with notices of
class and society meetings. A long table
runs almost the length of the narrow room.
On Mondays the janitor piles upon it the
week’s accumulation of dropped handkerchiefs,
for their owners to claim and carry
off. On other days college celebrities may sit
on it, swinging their feet comfortably while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
they beam on their admirers or wait to keep
a “date” with one of their “little pals.” It
is unwritten law that no freshmen save only
the president, vice-president, and Students’
Council member may sit, or even lean, on the
note-room table.</p>

<p>The note-room is always crowded between
classes, and on this first disorganized,
rainy morning it was a favorite rendezvous.
As Betty and Georgia wormed a slow passage
through the crowd near the door, they could
see Miss Marie O’Toole, dressed, quite without
regard for the weather, in a furbelowed silk
gown, a huge be-flowered hat, and—of all
things at Harding!—gloves, perched comfortably
on the sacred table, between Fluffy Dutton
and a clever little sophomore named
Susanna Hart. Fluffy was all smiles and attention;
Susanna’s black eyes twinkled with
suppressed glee. Around the table surged a
mob of girls, all amused but the freshmen,
who were deeply and seriously interested in
what was going on.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I shall like it here,” Marie
was saying in her sweet, piercing voice. “It’s
so friendly and informal—not a bit like Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Mallon’s Select School ‘pour les Americaines’
in dear old Paree. I’ve talked to lots of nice
girls this morning. I can’t remember half
their names, but they nearly all promised to
call on me. You will too, won’t you?” She
beamed impartially on Fluffy and Susanna.</p>

<p>“Maybe, if we have time. Got a crush
yet?” inquired Fluffy sweetly.</p>

<p>“A what?” Marie’s face was blank.</p>

<p>Fluffy explained.</p>

<p>Marie giggled consciously. “You embarrass
me, Miss Dutton. You go off and stand in a
corner of the hall for a minute, and I’ll tell
the rest of these girls whether I’ve got a crush
or not,—and what her name is.”</p>

<p>Fluffy slipped obediently off the table, and
then pulled the amazed Marie roughly after
her. “Freshmen aren’t allowed on this
table,” she announced sternly. “You’d better
go home and read the rules of this college.
There’s a rule about crushes, too. And about
asking upper-class girls to call.” Then
tender-hearted Fluffy relented and held out
her hand. “I must go now,” she said.
“But it won’t be against the rules for me to
call on you, and I will. Where do you live?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>Marie explained, her gaiety somewhat subdued.
Just then she caught sight of Betty
and Georgia, who had at last succeeded in getting
somewhere near the sacred table.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Wales,” she cried eagerly.
“Here I am, and I need your help right
away. Where can I find a set of the college
rules—about calls, and crushes, and sitting on
tables like this one, and so on?”</p>

<p>“And passing exams in freshman math.,”
murmured Fluffy wickedly, hazarding a guess
that Marie’s brain was not of the exact, scientific
variety. “How do you do, Betty? I’m
coming to the Tally-ho for tea and a talk to-night—Straight
too. You’ll be there?”</p>

<p>Betty said yes, trying to look properly reproachful
and not succeeding at all. Meanwhile
the crowd had drawn back, old girls
having whispered to the gaping freshmen that
Miss Wales was a “near-faculty.”</p>

<p>“Shall we come over to my office?” Betty
suggested, nodding right and left to girls she
recognized. Marie covered her silken elegance
with a natty white polo coat, and thoughtfully
insisted on carrying the umbrella over
Betty on the way back to her office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“Just look at that, Miss Wales,” she began,
as soon as they were seated, handing Betty a
printed list of the accepted freshman candidates.
“I’m in. I wouldn’t believe it till I
saw it down in black and white. And I’m
the only O in a class of two hundred. Isn’t
that funny, Miss Wales?”</p>

<p>Betty looked sympathetically at the name
of the only O in the freshman class. There
it was, down in black and white: Montana
Marie O’Toole.</p>

<p>“Oh, how f——” began Betty, who was
fast being overwhelmed by the accumulating
absurdities of her protégée. “Why, I—I
thought Marie was your first name.”</p>

<p>Marie giggled. “I’m always called Marie—now.
Ma would be awfully mad if she saw
that ridiculous old Montana cropping out
again. But they told us, when I took my
first exams, to put down our full names. I
asked if ‘M. Marie’ wouldn’t do, and the
teacher in charge of the room just glared at
me; so of course I wrote it all out in full about
as quick as I could. You see, Miss Wales, I
was born in a mining camp, and Pa named me
after the claim where he’d struck it rich the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
very day I came into the world. The Montana
Mary it was called. When I went to Salt
Lake to school I dropped the Montana, and
when I went to Paris I changed Mary to
Marie. Marie suits me better, don’t you think
so, Miss Wales?”</p>

<p>Marie got up to shed her heavy polo coat,
and stood, a dazzlingly pretty vision, smiling
down at Betty with the half-pleading, half-commanding
curve of her lips that made her
so winning in spite of her crudities.</p>

<p>Betty smiled back at her. “You’ll be
Montana Marie as long as you stay here,” she
told her freshman. “So you’d better make
up your mind to it. The girls always seize
upon a queer name and use it. If you’d written
just Marie, you might have been nicknamed
something funny; so it would come to
the same thing in the end. Now may I tell
you a few things, please?”</p>

<p>Betty repeated sister Nan’s suggestions to her
when she was a freshman about not making
friends too hastily. Then she arranged hours
for special lessons, helped Marie with her
schedule of classes, answered her frank queries
about the desirability of being friends with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
Georgia Ames and Fluffy Dutton. Then she
rushed off to settle the complicated case of
Mary Jones, who lived at the other end of
High Street, ate a hasty luncheon, held a
lengthy conference with the Morton Hall
matron, who had not the least idea how to
hurry through her business, made a friendly
call on “the Thorn,” a student who had given
some trouble the last year, and whose mother
had died during the summer. And finally
Betty turned up, fresh and smiling, at the
Tally-ho in time to take Emily’s place at the
desk, while that young lady combined a marketing
expedition with a drive behind Mary’s
new thoroughbred.</p>

<p>At five Fluffy and Straight appeared and
ordered tea at a table drawn sociably near to
Betty’s desk.</p>

<p>“Please notice our senior dignity,” observed
Straight. “We’re not going to be so harum-scarum
any longer.”</p>

<p>“I noticed Fluffy’s senior dignity this
morning,” Betty told them with a twinkle.</p>

<p>The two exchanged significant glances and
then made a simultaneous rush for Betty’s
desk, which they leaned over sociably, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
unmistakable attitude of those having confidential
information to discuss.</p>

<p>“Please tell us if her name is really Montana
Marie,” began Straight abruptly.</p>

<p>“And how you happen to have her under
your wing,” added Fluffy.</p>

<p>“And then we promise to be very nice to
her,” concluded Straight. “Besides, Fluffy
says that she likes her.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be very nice to her anyway, if you
want us to, Betty,” Fluffy explained sweetly.
“But we’re just bursting to know about her
and her beautiful name.”</p>

<p>“Just can’t put our minds on anything
else,” murmured Straight sadly. “And I
can’t afford to risk a mess of warnings this
year after all the trouble I had with logic
when I was a junior.”</p>

<p>“In short,” concluded Fluffy impressively,
“Montana Marie O’Toole is the sensation of
the hour at Harding College. Do you ask me
to prove it? Watch the Dutton twins forget
their cakes and tea while they talk about
her.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>THE INITIATION OF MONTANA MARIE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Montana Marie O’Toole</span> was, even as
Fluffy Dutton had said, the sensation of the
hour at Harding College. Indeed, she bid
fair to be the chief sensation of the entire year
of 19—. Her cheerful interest in the curious
rites and customs of college life continued undiminished,
in spite of elaborate snubs from
upper-class girls and the crushing scorn of her
fellow freshmen, who attempted, all in vain,
to keep Marie (and so Marie’s class) out of the
public eye. Nothing escaped Montana Marie’s
smiling scrutiny. Her questions were frank
and to the point. Her pithy comments were
quoted from end to end of the Harding
campus, and beyond. But her giggle was
contagious, her sweetness really appealing, her
appreciation of any small favors touching in
its breezy Western sincerity. Montana Marie
had “done” New York and the European
capitals; she had been “finished” in “dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
old Paree”; but she had also been born and
brought up in a Montana mining camp, and
she was not ashamed of that fact, nor of her
very plain, as well as very peculiar, parentage.
So Harding College agreed with Fluffy Dutton
in liking Montana Marie. Its laugh at her
was always friendly, if merciless, and in time
it came to be even rather admiring. But that
was not until long after the initiation of
Montana Marie.</p>

<p>Susanna Hart planned that joyous festivity.
Since Madeline Ayres had planned a similar
one for Georgia and the Dutton twins and
some of their Belden House classmates, and
Betty Wales had explained and defended the
Harding variety of initiation to an amused
faculty investigating committee, there had
been no official opposition to the hazing of
freshmen at Harding. Hazing (Harding
brand) was recognized as just an ingenious,
“stunty” way of entertaining the newcomers,
of finding out their best points, of helping
them to show the stuff they were made of, and
to take their proper places in the little college
world,—in short, of getting acquainted without
loss of time, or any foolish fuss and feathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>So being initiated had speedily come to be
considered an honor instead of a torment. All
the most popular freshmen were initiated—in
very small and select parties calculated to give
each individual her due importance. And
because of the extreme popularity—or prominence—of
Montana Marie O’Toole, Susanna
Hart decided that she should have an initiation
all to herself. So she asked Marie to
dinner at the Belden on a rainy Saturday
night when there was nothing else going on.
The initiation feature of the evening’s entertainment
was not mentioned to Montana
Marie; it was to be sprung upon her as a
pleasant little after-dinner surprise. Susanna
and her sophomore and senior friends in the
Belden spent the whole afternoon arranging
the “mise en scène” for the mystic ceremonies;
and they made so much noise tacking up curtains
and building a spring-board in Susanna’s
big closet that Straight Dutton, who had a bad
headache and was trying to sleep it off, came
up-stairs, with rage in her heart, to find out
what was happening.</p>

<p>Fluffy, who was acting as Susanna’s chief
assistant, explained. “We thought you were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
asleep, so we didn’t come to tell you,” she
ended.</p>

<p>Straight sniffed indignantly. “I was likely
to be asleep—underneath this carpenter shop.”</p>

<p>“Stay and help us, and drown your sorrows
in fudge and——”</p>

<p>“Noise,” finished Straight crisply. “No,
thanks. I’m going to ask Eugenia Ford to
massage my forehead. She’s wonderful at it.
Tell me what everything is for, and then I’ll
go back.”</p>

<p>Fluffy gleefully exhibited a glove full of wet
sand which Montana Marie was to be induced
to shake in the dark, as she entered the dusky
Chamber of Horrors, otherwise Susanna’s
single. There was a part of a real skeleton to
run into; there were clammy things and
hot things and wriggly things to touch; and
finally there was the spring-board to fall from,
down upon a heap of pillows, surrounded
by a bewildering, fluttering hedge composed
of Susanna’s generous wardrobe, carefully
spread out on all Susanna’s dress-hangers, and
those of some friends.</p>

<p>“She’ll never get out of that closet until we
haul her out,” concluded Fluffy joyously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
“Isn’t it going to be an extra-special initiation,
Straight?”</p>

<p>Straight nodded in silence, reëxamined all
the arrangements with polite attention to details,
and departed, wearing the pained expression
appropriate to one with a bad headache.</p>

<p>Five minutes later she was sitting cross-legged
on Eugenia Ford’s couch, her cheeks
still pale, but her eyes dancing with mirth and
excitement.</p>

<p>“Of course I’m a loyal senior, and I ought
by rights to be up-stairs with Fluffy helping
the sophs,” she outlined her position rapidly.
“But they’ve got enough help without me,
and the racket did bother me fearfully, and
made me mad, and besides, the juniors’ Rescue
party that I’m going to organize will be a
grand feature, so they really ought to thank
me for seeming to bother them. How many
juniors are there in the house, Eugenia?
Well, Timmy Wentworth counts against two
of the sophs, because she’s so big, and that big
corner double room she and Sallie Wright
have is the very best place in the house for
our extra-special show. Now where can we
borrow masks and black dominos? I have an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
idea that raw oysters dipped in hot chocolate
sauce would taste rather weird. They never
have had uncanny eats at the initiations I’ve
been to, so that will be an original stroke.
You go tell the others and buy the oysters and
borrow chocolate and find the clothes and get
the night watchman to lend you a lot of rope.
I’ll take a nice little nap here on your couch,
away from that sophomore racket, and at five
we all round up in Timmy’s room to arrange.”</p>

<p>Having thus relieved herself of all minor
details, after a fashion taught her by her good
friend Madeline Ayres, Straight curled up
among Eugenia’s downy pillows, and slept
sweetly and very soundly until Eugenia and
Timmy Wentworth shook her awake with the
information that there were not enough black
dominos and it was quarter past five.</p>

<p>The Belden House juniors appeared at dinner
that night late and rather disheveled.
Straight, because she had a headache, did not
appear at all, and thereby missed seeing Montana
Marie sweep through the Belden House
parlors between the triumphant Susanna and
Fluffy Dutton, the latter not too much worried
about her twin’s unprecedented indisposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
to miss any of the humors of the situation.
For Susanna and her friends, being
rather tired and hurried, and wishing also to
be suitably clothed for darkling adventures
in Susanna’s closet, had not dressed very formally
for dinner. Against their background
of shirt-waists and walking skirts or plain little
muslins, Montana Marie sparkled radiantly
in a clinging, trailing yellow satin, cut
low enough to show the lovely curves of her
throat and long enough to give just a glimpse
of her high-heeled gold slippers and to lend
her a quite sumptuous dignity among her
short-skirted companions. A jeweled fillet
held her piled-up hair in the exaggerated
mode of the moment—it was becoming to
Montana Marie. Diamonds sparkled at her
throat and on her fingers. In short, Montana
Marie was perfectly dressed for twenty-two
and a formal dinner,—but not for a school-girl
nor for any little after-dinner surprise
in the way of an extra-special initiation
party.</p>

<p>“It would be tragic to have to jump off a
spring-board in those clothes,” Fluffy whispered
sadly to a sophomore neighbor. “We’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
have to manage somehow to dress her over for
the part.”</p>

<p>“She’s about my size; she can take my
white linen with the braided trimming,” the
sophomore agreed magnanimously. “It’s
rather dirty, I’m sorry to say, but that’s really
an advantage for to-night.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell Susanna,” promised Fluffy, “and
she’ll have to arrange. Why in the world
didn’t she tell Miss Montana Marie O’Toole
not to dress up like a princess?”</p>

<p>But Susanna, though she employed all her
far-famed diplomacy, could not “arrange”
any changes in her guest’s wonderful toilette.
When she proposed a little walk in the rain,
and said it would be a shame to risk spoiling
that lovely dress, Montana Marie only smiled,
and picked up her train.</p>

<p>“I shan’t spoil it,” she said. “I never
spoil my clothes. But I’d love a walk in
the rain—with you and Fluffy. Yes, or a
fudge party up-stairs. Just whatever you
say.”</p>

<p>And no amount of hints and polite protests
could make Montana Marie change her mind.</p>

<p>So it was that, still smiling and still arrayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
in clinging bejeweled yellow satin, Montana
Marie shook hands with a gloveful of wet
sand, at the door of Susanna’s Chamber of
Horrors, stuck her arms through a hole in the
Curtain of Variety, and shrieked as she
grasped first a hot potato, then a large and
lively lobster, and finally a paper snake freshly
dipped in thick white paint by Fluffy, so that
it would be sure to feel extra-crawly. Next,
after she had assured her captors that she
was enjoying it all,—they inquired at intervals
according to the etiquette of hazing
(Harding brand),—she was led up to the skeleton,
which promptly tumbled over upon her
with a gruesome rattle of dry bones. And
finally came the spring-board and the cushions,
hemmed in by Susanna’s hanging dresses,
from behind which three little sophomores
delivered horrible noises, accompanying soft,
uncanny pats and pushes, while Montana
Marie, still cheerful, though badly scared,
minus one gold slipper, and quite helplessly
entangled in her long train, struggled manfully
to regain her feet and maintain her
composure.</p>

<p>When they were tired of watching her try<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
to get out, they turned on a sudden blaze
of lights, pulled down the dresses that had
been hung across the door, helped Montana
Marie to arise, returned her slipper, and arranged
her train.</p>

<p>Montana Marie blinked at the lights, and
smiled blandly at the assembled company.
“Nothing like this in dear old Paree,” she
announced, gasping but happy. “Now at
Miss Mallon’s Select School for American
Girls——”</p>

<p>“Hush,” commanded Fluffy. “We aren’t
interested in any silly little boarding-school
stories. This is a grown-up college. But as
you seem to want to talk, go ahead—make a
speech.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_054">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_054.jpg" alt="GO AHEAD—MAKE A SPEECH">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“GO AHEAD—MAKE A SPEECH”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“On the subject of the Fourth Dimension,”
put in Susanna hastily. “We are all very
tired of dear old Paree.”</p>

<p>“But I never heard of——” began Montana
Marie.</p>

<p>“Sh!” commanded Susanna sternly. “If
you say you’ve never heard of a thing like
the Fourth Dimension, why, here at Harding
that means social ostracism. To use simpler
language suitable for very verdant little girls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
like you, not to have heard of the Fourth
Dimension is a mark of complete and utter
greenness, perfect and unbearable freshness,
and even worse. If you haven’t heard of it,
all right, but don’t say so, unless you want to
be finally and forever dropped like—like a
hot potato,”—Susanna glanced smilingly at
the Curtain of Variety,—“by the best Harding
circles. If you haven’t heard of it, why, bluff.
Now don’t tell me you never heard of bluffing.”</p>

<p>“Well,” began Montana Marie, still smiling
composedly, “you see I never heard of a lot
of things that you do here, because I was
mostly educated in a convent, I suppose.
President Wallace understands that. That’s
why he let me in when——”</p>

<p>Marie was too much absorbed in her speech,
and her audience were too busy laughing at
her confidential disclosures, to notice a slight
commotion near the door. A second later the
room was full of masked figures in black
dominos. Two especially stalwart ones
guarded the door. The rest drew a cordon
around the amazed initiators and producing
pieces of stout rope—procured, according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Straight’s directions, from the night watchman,
who was under the impression that it
was wanted by the Belden House matron for
strange purposes of her own—they silently
bound their prisoners, who were too astonished
even to struggle, and started them in procession
out the door and up the hall.</p>

<p>Suddenly a black domino cried, “Stop—I
mean—halt, prisoners! We’ve forgotten something.”</p>

<p>For Montana Marie O’Toole still stood as
she had been commanded to do to make her
speech, on the quivering middle of the spring-board
in the closet, viewing the performances
of the black dominos with mingled surprise
and amusement, manifested, as usual with her,
by a smile, rather faint now, but still somehow
infectious.</p>

<p>“We’ve forgotten the principal feature,” the
voice went on. “Montana Marie O’Toole, get
down. You’re no longer a persecuted little
freshman. You’ve been nobly rescued by
your junior protectors. Now come and see
justice done on these base tormentors of youth
and beauty.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Marie calmly, scrambling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
down from her uncertain perch and losing
off a slipper again in the process.</p>

<p>Susanna picked it up and handed it to her
meekly.</p>

<p>“You’re a champion bluffer, if you don’t know
what it means,” Fluffy told her admiringly.
“I suppose you knew all the time that they
were coming, and that was why you just giggled
at everything and let us do our worst.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie O’Toole smiled vaguely back
at Fluffy. “Oh, no, I didn’t know——” she
began.</p>

<p>“Of course she didn’t know,” cut in a black
domino. “Do you think we ask the advice
of freshmen——”</p>

<p>“Straight Dutton,” cried Fluffy indignantly,
“what are you doing helping a lot of
juniors? You belong with us.”</p>

<p>The black domino, thus reproached, shrugged
her shoulders defiantly. “You spoiled my
nap and made me mad.” Then she laughed.
“You won’t be a bit mad after we’ve finished
with you. Truly you won’t. We’ve
got lovely stunts and the weirdest eats.
Forward march, captives,—and hurry, or we
shan’t have time for everything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>Enthroned on Timmy Wentworth’s writing
table, with Eugenia Ford to coach her in the
lines of her part, Montana Marie O’Toole
acted as mistress of the Rescue ceremonies.</p>

<p>“Fluffy Dutton, turn your dress backside
front and inside out and speak a piece.”</p>

<p>“Eugenia Ford, tell us the whole and complete
story of the Winsted men you have
flirted with since last week Wednesday.”</p>

<p>“Mary Mason, sing the Rosary without
stopping to laugh.”</p>

<p>“Tilly Ann Leavitt, do your Chantecler
stunt—all through.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie announced each “lovely
stunt,” after Eugenia had whispered it to her,
with much dignity. She watched its performance
gaily, and greeted its climax with a gurgle
of appreciative laughter.</p>

<p>When the sun—it was a big jack-o’-lantern,
and it had been hastily sent for from Tilly
Ann’s room, to make her Chantecler stunt
complete—when the sun came up over Timmy
Wentworth’s screen and sent long, streaming
rays of orange ribbon over the room and the
audience, Montana Marie O’Toole lay back
gasping in Eugenia’s arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“I saw that play acted in French, in dear
old Paree. Did Miss Leavitt see it there too?
Did she make up that take-off herself? Oh,
my, I feel so perfectly at home here now!”
Montana Marie rocked back and forth in an
ecstasy of mirth and satisfaction.</p>

<p>“The world is such a small place,” she
added with much originality, and smiled impartially
on all classes present.</p>

<p>Then they turned out the lights and had
the “weird eats”—the largest raw oysters to
be bought in Harding, dipped in very thick,
very hot chocolate sauce. And then they had
“real food,” namely: Cousin Kate’s cookies
and pineapple ice. Eugenia had requisitioned
the “real food” of Betty Wales, at Straight’s
instigation.</p>

<p>“If we gallantly rescue her freshman, she
certainly ought to do something nice for us,”
Straight had declared. “Tell her that we prefer
ice to ice-cream, because we—I—have recently
had a headache, and I feel for ice.
Tell her she will be an angel to send the
things because we haven’t had a dessert that I
like this whole long week.”</p>

<p>And Betty, who understood all about campus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
fare, smilingly promised, and was better
than her word to the extent of a huge pitcher
of lemonade.</p>

<p>Montana Marie was proving rather an amusing
protégée, she reflected that evening, after
Thomas, the new door and errand boy, had
been dispatched to the Belden with the “real
eats.” The girls liked her, in spite of her queerness,
and so did the faculty; at least several
of them had spoken of her to Betty in very
friendly terms. College had been open nearly
a month now, but Montana Marie had not
asked for any help from her official tutor except
with her entrance conditions. The one
in history she was almost ready to pass off,
Betty thought. She made a note on her engagement
pad: “Ask M. M. how freshman
work is going, specially math.” Betty smiled
to herself, as she remembered how scared all
the Chapin House crowd had been over their
freshman math. And then in the end nobody
had been even warned except Roberta, and that
was because she was always too frightened that
first year to try to recite; Roberta was labeled
a “math. shark” before she graduated.</p>

<p>Betty wondered how the Rescue party was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
progressing. She wished she were not a “near-faculty,”
with faculty dignity to sustain.
She longed to borrow a black domino and a
mask and join the Rescue party incognito.
She thought of a deliciously funny “stunt” to
suggest as Susanna Hart’s penalty for having
instigated Montana Marie’s hazing party.
She hoped her freshman would be game—would
make them keep on liking her—now
that they had begun.</p>

<p>She stayed late at the Tally-ho working on
her accounts, and reached the campus just in
time to run into Montana Marie O’Toole being
escorted home,—at top speed, owing to the
exigencies of the ten o’clock rule,—by Eugenia,
the Dutton twins, reunited without loss
of time, and Susanna Hart.</p>

<p>Straight detached herself from escort duty
to tell Betty all about the party. “Part two,
the Rescue, was a grand, extra-special success,”
she explained, “and the sophs say that part
one was just as good. I say, Betty, did you
give us away? Did you tell Montana Marie
about the Rescue?”</p>

<p>Betty hadn’t even seen her freshman for two
days, until to-night’s brief encounter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>Straight considered. “I wonder if somebody
else told her. She didn’t act a bit surprised.
But then she never does act surprised,
no matter what happens or what wild tales we
stuff her with. Betty, have you noticed how
you can’t ever tell what she thinks?”</p>

<p>Betty laughed. “I never can tell what
people think, Straight, unless they tell me.
It’s only Madeline and you clever twins who
can read people’s minds.”</p>

<p>“Only some people’s,” Straight corrected
modestly. “And I don’t believe even the
wonderful Madeline could read Montana
Marie’s. She’s queer. That’s the only word
that describes her,—except pretty, of course,—just
queer. First you laugh at her, then you
like her, and before you get tired of her foolishness
you get awfully interested in studying
her out. And you can’t. Can’t make her
out, I mean. Betty——” Straight paused
at the door of Morton Hall.</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Betty.</p>

<p>“Ask her if she knew about to-night’s Rescue
party, will you?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Betty promised. “Fly now,
Straight, or you’ll be locked out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“Never.” Straight prepared to fly her fastest.
“I’ll bet you anything, Betty Wales,
that you won’t ever find out. Whether she
knew, I mean. Good-night, Betty.”</p>

<p>Straight had flown.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>MONTANA MARIE TAKES A RIDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgia Ames</span> had missed Montana Marie’s
initiation party, having been engaged that
evening in helping to console Mary Brooks
Hinsdale for the temporary loss of her husband.</p>

<p>“Clever husbands are so intermittent,”
Mary had sighed plaintively. “Now you
have them to provide tea for, and other
amusements, and now they’re off to the ends
of the earth to deliver a lecture. And mine
won’t ever take me along, because my frivolous
aspect rattles him when he gets up to
speak. I presume,” Mary smiled serenely,
“that he also thinks said frivolous aspect
would queer him with his learned friends;
only he’s too polite to put it to me so
baldly. And the moral of all this, Georgia,
my child, is: Don’t marry a professor, unless
you are prepared to take the consequences.
The immediate consequence is that you’ve got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
to be Georgia-to-the-Rescue for me this time,
and come up to spend Saturday night.”</p>

<p>“And so,” Georgia explained to Betty later,
“I wasn’t on hand to be Georgia-to-the-Rescue
for your freshman. But then she didn’t
need me. She really didn’t even need rescuing.
And just to show her how I admire
her pluck, I’ve made the riding-party I’m
going off with ask her to come on our Mountain
Day trip.”</p>

<p>“But she can’t possibly get a horse so late
in the day,” objected Betty.</p>

<p>“Belle Joyce has sprained her ankle and
gone home, so somebody else can have the
Imp.”</p>

<p>Betty looked anxious. “But, Georgia dear,
you know the Imp is a pretty lively horse.
Are you sure that Marie rides well enough to
go off on him with your experienced crowd?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess so,” Georgia answered easily.
“She’s ridden a lot out West, she says. She’s
telegraphed to Montana for her own saddle
and her riding things, and they ought to be
here to-day. When they come, I’ll take her
out on a practice trip to be sure that she can
ride. Nobody wants to kill off your amusing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
freshman, Betty; so don’t look so awfully
solemn.”</p>

<p>Betty laughed heartily. “Well, you know
I had a nice spill here once myself, and so I
believe in being careful. But I think it was
ever so nice of you to include Marie in your
party, Georgia.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t a freshman in college who
wouldn’t give her best hat for the chance of
going off with our crowd,” Georgia declared
modestly. “It’s funny, isn’t it, Betty, how
much the girls care about getting in with the
right college set?”</p>

<p>Betty nodded. “And I’m afraid it’s not
because the right college set, as you call it,
generally has the most fun. It’s very often
only because they are silly enough to want
the name of being popular.”</p>

<p>“Snobs!” muttered Georgia scornfully.
“Well, Montana Marie is no snob, and
thanks mostly to you there aren’t nearly so
many snobs in Harding as there were when I
first came up.”</p>

<p>“Really? Do you notice a difference?”
demanded Betty eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, and lots of it,” declared Georgia, “so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
don’t work too hard this year creating the
proper college spirit, because you don’t need
to. And don’t worry about our killing off
your freshman. Unless I see that she’s a very
good rider on our trial trip, I’ll make her
swap off the Imp with one of the girls who
can surely manage him, and take old Polly.
Old Polly wouldn’t hurt a fly.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie’s pet saddle and riding
clothes did not come until just in time for
Mountain Day, but Georgia took her, according
to promise, for the practice ride, borrowing
Straight Dutton’s skirt for her, and explaining
that it was Harding custom not to bother
about hats.</p>

<p>Montana Marie listened graciously to
Georgia’s sage advice about being very careful
until you knew your horse; and she made no
objection to starting out on Polly, who was a
meek-looking, gentle-gaited bay with one
white foot,—the idol of timid beginners in
Harding riding circles. But before they had
gone a mile, Montana Marie drew rein and
announced pleasantly that she couldn’t ride
Polly a step further.</p>

<p>“I suppose I must be too heavy for her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
She seems so tired, and she lags behind so.
Would you be willing to change with me, Miss
Ames? You are lighter, and you are used to
Polly’s ways. You don’t blame me, do you,
for hating to use up a horse?”</p>

<p>So Montana Marie rode Georgia’s favorite
Captain, who single-footed by choice but
would canter if crowded to it. He cantered
with Montana Marie all the way to Far-away
Glen, the destination of the party. There
they dismounted to drink out of a mountain
spring, and Montana Marie somehow settled
it that the groom from the stables should go
back on Polly, Captain being restored to
Georgia, and the skittish roan named Gold
Heels left for herself. Georgia protested anxiously,
but Montana Marie smiled and reassured
her.</p>

<p>“Why, you can’t worry about me, Miss Ames.
I’ve ridden all my life,” she said, making the
roan curvet and prance on purpose. “I guess
I rode before I walked. But these pancake
saddles are the limit, I think. Just you wait
till my own outfit comes, and then I’ll show
you some real riding. My, but it seems like
old times to be on a horse! I had just one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
ride all the time we were in Paris. Riding in
a park is too slow for me, and besides I hate
side-saddles—you can’t use anything else over
there, you know—as I hate—select schools for
girls,” added Montana Marie in an unwonted
burst of confidence.</p>

<p>“So you’re glad to be back in America?”
asked Georgia idly.</p>

<p>“I should say I am, Miss Ames. Some day
you’ll know, maybe, just how glad I am.”</p>

<p>Georgia was too busy keeping Captain from
imitating the roan’s pernicious tactics in the
matter of shying at dead leaves to wonder
exactly what Montana Marie was driving at so
earnestly.</p>

<p>“She will be perfectly safe on the Imp,”
Georgia reported later to Betty. “At least I
think so, and anyhow she is perfectly set on
riding him, and she said she’d never ride old
Polly again, if there wasn’t another horse in
the world. So we shall just have to let her
decide about the risks for herself. Your
freshman has a mind of her own, hasn’t she,
Betty?”</p>

<p>Betty agreed laughingly. Montana Marie,
when approached by her official tutor about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
her freshman class work, particularly freshman
math., had reported easily that she guessed
everything was going all right.</p>

<p>“But anyway, I’m planning to get my entrance
conditions off first,” she announced.
“Then I can devote my whole time to regular
work. I believe in being systematic, don’t
you, Miss Wales?”</p>

<p>Betty tried to explain that the entrance
conditions were regarded by the Powers as
extras, not to take the place or time of regular
work. Montana Marie listened good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“I never could do but one thing at once,
Miss Wales,” she explained at last. “In
Germany I forget every word I know of
French, and in dear old Paree I actually almost
forget my English. If I could only cut
classes entirely for a week or so and get this
entrance history and Latin prose off my
mind!”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t,” Betty told her decidedly.
“Your having so many conditions will make
all your teachers specially particular. The
very least you can do, when President Wallace
stretched a rule to let you in, is not to cut a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
single, single class, unless you are too ill to
go, of course.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie sighed plaintively. “I
never was ill in my life. I think I am doing
fairly well in my studies, Miss Wales. I certainly
try hard enough. After all the fuss I
had about getting in, I don’t want to get out
again yet a while. The great trouble is that
there are so many social affairs all the time.
When I’m looking forward to a dinner on
the campus or a dance in the gym. or a walk
with that cute little Miss Hart, why I just
can’t settle down to study. It was lucky Miss
Hart had an impromptu initiation for me. I
shouldn’t have been able to learn a single
lesson with an initiation to look forward to.”</p>

<p>“Then if it diverts your mind to go to
things, you simply mustn’t go to so many,
Marie.” Betty tried to look severe and to
speak sternly. “You must refuse some of
your invitations. Or else you must learn to
concentrate your mind on whatever you’re
doing, work as well as play. Being able to
jump straight from Greek to the sophomore
reception and from chemistry lab. into
managing a basket-ball team is one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
most valuable things you can learn at this
college. And you’ve got to learn it early in
freshman year, or you won’t ever get comfortably
through your mid-years.” Betty surveyed
Montana Marie’s unruffled calm rather despairingly.</p>

<p>Montana Marie smiled comfortingly back at
her tutor, and then sighed faintly. “I’m not
sure, Miss Wales, that I have any mind to concentrate.
You see in the convent your soul
was the most important thing, and in Miss
Mallon’s Select School for American Girls
your manners and the pictures in the Louvre
were the most important. But I promise you
that I won’t go everywhere I’m asked—not
anywhere until I’ve passed off my history.
And I promise not to cut, and I’ll ask my
teachers right away if my work is satisfactory.”</p>

<p>Betty wrote her mother that night that
Marie was developing wonderfully, quite as
Mrs. Wales had prophesied, and that taking
charge of her was really no trouble at all,
because she was so anxious to carry out her
part of the bargain she had made with Betty,
to do her best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“So tell Will to tell Tom Benson,” Betty
wrote, “that Miss O’Toole isn’t a handful.
I’m almost afraid she’ll turn out a dig or a
prig or something of that kind, she seems so
anxious to do good work. But all the nicest
girls like her, so I guess I needn’t worry about
her not having a good time.”</p>

<p>The day before Mountain Day the history
condition was removed from Miss Montana
Marie O’Toole’s record of scholarship, and
Betty congratulated her freshman warmly
and went off to spend the holiday in Babe’s
wonderful house on the Hudson feeling as
care-free and irresponsible as if she were a
freshman herself.</p>

<p>Georgia’s riding-party was to take horse—this
knowing expression was also Georgia’s—at
the Belden at nine o’clock sharp. At a
quarter before the hour Montana Marie, the
only off-campus member, arrived at the rendezvous.
Her habit was brown corduroy, her
hat a flapping sombrero, her lovely hair was
coiled in a soft knot in her neck. It looked
as if it would fall down before she had
mounted, but not a lock was out of place that
night, when Montana Marie rode the dripping,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
drooping Imp into his stable-yard half an
hour ahead of the others, and sweetly asked
the liveryman if he would mind giving her a
real horse the next time she hired one.</p>

<p>“Because if you can’t, I guess I’ll ask my
father to send one of his East to me,” she explained,
reaching down to unbuckle her big
saddle before she slipped easily out of it. “I
don’t mean to compare this horse with old
Polly or that silly roan,” she added politely.
“But I do like a little real excitement when I
go for a ride.”</p>

<p>If Montana Marie had found her Mountain
Day tame, the rest of the party had not
lacked for “real excitement” in generous
measure. Montana Marie had ridden decorously
enough between Georgia and Susanna
Hart out of the town and up Sugar Hill to
White Birch Lane. At the turn into the
woods she had produced a magenta silk bandana
and knotted it coquettishly at the back
of her neck.</p>

<p>“Now I’m a real cow-girl,” she explained.
“Ma can educate me all she wants, but she
can’t educate the West out of me. She’d
never have sent me this wild and woolly outfit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
She’d have written her New York tailor
to come right up here and fit me out. But I
like these things best, so I just telegraphed to
Dad, and he did as I said. He always does.
Now why don’t we race up the next hill?”
Montana Marie started off the Imp with a
yodeling shout and a wildly waving arm that
made even sedate old Polly take a keen interest
in following. Susanna Hart’s horse reared, and
Fluffy Dutton shrieked hysterically. Then
the skittish roan Gold Heels bolted down a
side-path with the groom from the stable, and
before he could get back to his charges’ assistance,
a Belden House sophomore, who was
always unlucky with horses, carelessly fell off
the Captain’s back. True to his training the
big horse stopped dead in his tracks, and Montana
Marie, having seen the accident over her
shoulder, rushed the Imp back, dismounted,
and assisted the unlucky sophomore to her
feet with the sincerest apologies for having
“made any one any trouble.”</p>

<p>“If you’d had a saddle like mine you
wouldn’t have fallen off,” she ended regretfully.
“You can’t enjoy a real wild ride on
those little flat seats.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“We’re not out for a wild ride,” Georgia rebuked
her sternly. “If you want to race and
make a general disturbance you must ride
way ahead alone. But if I were you——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shouldn’t think of stirring up anything
more,” declared Montana Marie demurely,
pulling the Imp into a decorous park-trot
beside the unlucky sophomore, who was
luckily not a bit the worse for her tumble.
“I’m only a little freshman, and I want to
learn the college ways in riding as in other
things.” She secreted her magenta neckerchief
again, and “rode like a perfect lady,” to
quote from Georgia’s account of the matter, all
the way to Top Notch Falls, and all the way
back against the sunset, until——</p>

<p>Little Eugenia Ford’s horrified description
of what happened next was perhaps the most
vivid of those furnished to eager inquirers.</p>

<p>“When we were down on the meadow-road,”
Eugenia began that evening to an attentive
audience of her house-mates, “it got a little
bit dusky. We heard some horses coming fast
behind us, and it was my Cousin John Ford,
who is a senior at Winsted, and three men
from his frat-house. They stopped to speak to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
me, and I introduced them to Fluffy and Montana
Marie, who were riding beside me. We
happened to be quite a little ahead of the
others. John said something about Montana
Marie’s queer Mexican saddle, and that freshman
put on her awful magenta handkerchief
again, and asked him if he liked cow-girls and
‘real exciting’ rides, and of course John said
yes. And she said to come on then, and hit
his horse with her whip, and they just tore
off in the dark.” Eugenia’s big brown eyes
were round with horror. “John is a splendid
rider or he wouldn’t have stayed on, because
his horse—it’s one of his own and a thoroughbred—had
never been touched with a whip before,
and it nearly went crazy when Montana
Marie whacked it. So his horse flew and the
Imp flew too, and John tried to stop, but she
just shouted again and again, and egged both
the horses on. John telephoned me as soon
as I got home, to say that his neck wasn’t
broken, and to inquire for hers. He seemed
to think it was a joke, but for my part”—Eugenia
looked as severe as so small and so
pretty a young lady was able to look—“for
my part I think it was unladylike and dangerous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
and I hope Georgia will never want to
ask her to go riding with us again. My horse
almost ran too.” Eugenia grew a shade more
haughty. “She asked John to call and to bring
his three friends. I—I’m afraid he’ll come.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be much surprised if he did,”
agreed a caustic senior, who roomed next door.
“Montana Marie O’Toole is not exactly a lady,
and she—well, I don’t know that she is ever exactly
inconsiderate except on horseback. But
she’s always interesting, foot or horseback.
Were your crowd—were you thinking of
dropping her because she messed up your
ride?”</p>

<p>Eugenia flushed. “She’s asked the Mountain
Day party to dinner to-morrow night at
the Vincent Arms. She boards there, you
know. She seems to be—very rich. I don’t
know much about her family, but Betty
Wales has met her mother and liked her. I—I
do want to see the inside of that wonderful
boarding-house.”</p>

<p>“Millionairesses’ Hall, isn’t it called?”
asked the senior. “Yes, I’ve wanted to go
there too, for dinner, but I don’t know anybody
who’ll ask me. They have flowers on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
the tables every night, and seven courses.
You’d better go.”</p>

<p>Eugenia considered. “It would be fun.
Only—she was really horrid—racing off that
way with John.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he won’t call on her, after all,”
consoled the senior. “If he does—eat her
dinner first, drop her afterward. But
whether you drop her or not, she’s bound to
stay in fashion here. She’s interesting, lady
or no lady. Don’t go riding with her, if you
don’t like her Western style. But for my
part, I think she’s really too good to miss.
Now isn’t it just like that lucky Betty Wales
to have the most entertaining freshman, as
well as the most fascinating tea-room, to
amuse herself with?”</p>

<p>At the very moment when the caustic senior
was making this remark, Betty Wales sat
at her desk in the fascinating tea-shop. The
entertaining freshman sat beside her. For
once she was not smiling. Spread out on the
desk before Betty were three distinct and separate
warnings, in freshman math., freshman
Latin, and freshman lit., respectively. Betty
Wales had seen a few warnings before, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
she did not remember any that were quite so
frank and unqualified in their condemnation
of the recipient’s scholastic efforts and attainments
as the three euphemistically addressed
to Miss M. M. O’Toole.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE B. C. A.’S “UNDERTAKE” MONTANA MARIE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeline Ayres</span> had come up to Harding
to celebrate the acceptance of a novel by her
favorite firm of publishers. Babbie Hildreth
had come too, to help Madeline celebrate, and
also to talk to Mr. Thayer about that most
important topic, the date of “the” wedding.
And so of course the “B. C. A.’s” had appointed
a special tea-drinking, to celebrate
the acceptance of the novel, the visits of Madeline
and Babbie, the prospect of a wedding in
their midst, and the general joys involved in
the state of being “Back at the College
Again,”—which is what B. C. A. stood for.
Equally of course the tea-drinking was to be
held at the Tally-ho.</p>

<p>But when the hour of the grand celebration
arrived, a damper was put on everything;
Betty Wales had sent a hastily scribbled note,
by an accommodating freshman who was going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
right past the Tally-ho, to say that she was too
busy to come.</p>

<p>“She’s losing her sporting spirit,” declared
Madeline sadly. “In days gone by you could
depend on Betty’s turning up for any old lark.
She might be late, if she happened to be
pretty busy, but she always got there in the
end.”</p>

<p>“And I wanted to ask her about wedding
dates,” wailed Babbie plaintively. “I can’t
have my wedding when Betty can’t come.
She’s almost as important as the groom.”</p>

<p>“Betty is awfully important to such a lot
of people,” complained Mary Brooks Hinsdale,
who was looking particularly fascinating in
her new fall suit, the christening of which
had added an extra spice of interest to the
grand tea-drinking. “She is altogether too
capable for her own good. If she were only as
lazy, or as unreliable, or as devoid of ideas
and energy, as most of those here present, she
wouldn’t find it so hard to escape for tea-drinkings
and other pleasant festivities.
Which one of her dependents has her in its
clutches this afternoon, I wonder?”</p>

<p>Babbie, to whom Betty’s note had been addressed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
consulted it for further details. “She
says she’s got to tutor a freshman,” Babbie explained
after a minute. “I suppose she is
helping along some one who can’t afford to
pay for regular lessons. Seems to me there
ought to be girls enough in college to do that
sort of thing without putting it off on Betty.
Betty is too valuable to be wasted on mere tutoring.”</p>

<p>“Poor girls ought not to need to be
tutored,” announced Madeline, in her oracular
manner. “Unless they are bright and
shining lights in their studies, they ought not
to try to go through college at all.”</p>

<p>“But Madeline——” chorused the permanent
B. C. A.’s—the ones who were always on
hand in Harding, because they were either
faculty or faculty wives. “But Babbie—you
two don’t understand. Haven’t you heard
about Betty’s freshman?”</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t,” chorused the new arrivals.
“Tell us this minute.”</p>

<p>Mary finally got the floor. “My children,”
she began in her most patronizing style, “our
precious Betty Wales is not engaged in assisting
some needy under classman along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
royal road to learning, as you seem to suppose.
She is acting as special tutor to the only
daughter of a Montana mining magnate.
Named Montana Marie after the mine, pretty
as a picture, clever at horseback riding but
not at mathematics,—and the grand sensation
of Harding College just at present,” ended
Mary proudly. Then the permanents told
the “properly excited” newcomers the whole
story of Montana Marie O’Toole.</p>

<p>“She sounds extremely interesting,” said
Madeline reflectively, when they had finished.</p>

<p>“Almost like a ready-made heroine,” suggested
Mary, winking knowingly at the others.</p>

<p>Madeline nodded absently, and everybody
laughed at what Mary called the egotism of
the literary instinct.</p>

<p>“Why, haven’t you ever caught Madeline
squinting at you to see if you’ll do for a
book?” demanded Mary, elaborating her
point. “She relates everything, even friends,
to her Literary Career. I wore my new suit
to-day in the frantic hope that she’d like my
looks well enough to put me into a play. I
should simply adore seeing myself in a play,”
sighed Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“Well, you never will,” Madeline assured
her blandly. “Not while you call me ‘my
child,’ and patronize me instead of my tea-shop.”</p>

<p>Mary listened, wearing her beamish smile.
“Egotism of the literary instinct again—she
makes a personal matter out of everything.
Now, if you’ve quite finished explaining your
methods of literary work, suppose we return to
the business of the meeting, which is——”</p>

<p>“Which seems to be your frivolous methods
of securing the attention of the wise and
great by wearing new clothes,” cut in Madeline
promptly. “A very interesting subject,
too, isn’t it, my children?”</p>

<p>Mary faced the challenger coldly. “The
real business of the meeting,” she announced,
“is the rescue of Betty Wales from the
clutches of her too-numerous jobs, charities,
helpful ideas, and noble ambitions, including
that interesting but heavily conditioned freshman,
Montana Marie O’Toole.”</p>

<p>“But I thought Georgia had been regularly
‘elected’ to look out for Betty,” suggested
Christy Mason.</p>

<p>“Well, Georgia is only one,” explained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
Helen Chase Adams seriously, “and being
a prominent senior keeps her fairly busy, I
imagine. And then Betty doesn’t want to be
rescued. It’s very hard to look out for a person
that doesn’t want you to look out for
him—her,” amended Helen hastily, with a
vivid blush that instantly created another
digression among the B. C. A.’s.</p>

<p>“I thought you didn’t like men, Helen
Chase.”</p>

<p>“Who is he? Who is your protégé who
objects to being looked after, Helen?”</p>

<p>“When you said ‘him’ you were only trying
to speak good English? Well, isn’t ‘her’
as good English as ‘him’?”</p>

<p>“You might as well own up to him right
off and save yourself a lot of trouble. Detective
Ayres will shadow you till you confess.”</p>

<p>But Helen displayed a hitherto unsuspected
talent for clever sparring. “It’s just like you
girls to make a lot out of a little,” she declared,
so earnestly that everybody saw she
meant it. “That’s why we have such good
times,—because you make all the stupid little
things in life seem interesting.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t dare to deny that you’re a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
stupid little thing,” Mary told her, with an
appreciative pat to emphasize that she was
only joking. “And please be duly thankful
that we can make even you seem interesting.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am grateful,” Helen told her, with
pretty seriousness. “But you ought to keep
within the probabilities, and you ought to
have more variety about your inventions.
We’ve got romances enough on hand, without
making up one for me.”</p>

<p>“The business of this meeting——” began
Mary again at last, pounding hard on the
table with one of the fascinating fat mustard
jars which Madeline had summarily bought
in London to start the Tally-ho Tea-Shop.
“The business of this meeting——”</p>

<p>“Is just coming in at the door,” Rachel
Morrison laughingly finished Mary’s sentence
for her.</p>

<p>And sure enough, Betty Wales, looking
very young, very pretty, also very care-free
and happy for a person in dire need of rescue,
was shutting the door with one hand, giving
Emily Davis a handful of letters and memoranda
with the other, and telling Nora about a
special dinner order for that evening as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
slipped off her ulster. Then she made a bee-line
for Jack o’ Hearts’ stall and the Merry
Hearts.</p>

<p>“Let me in—way in, please,” she begged,
scrambling past Babbie, Helen, and Mary to
the most secluded seat at the back of the stall.
“I came after all, because I wanted some fun,
and I won’t be dragged out to talk to anybody
about dinners they want me to plan, or Student’s
Aid things, or Morton Hall things—or
even a conditioned freshman,” she concluded
with a particularly vindictive emphasis
on the last phrase.</p>

<p>“Hear! Hear!” cried Christy Mason.</p>

<p>“Oh, now I think maybe she’ll run away
again to come to my wedding,” sighed Babbie,
in deep relief.</p>

<p>“After all, she hasn’t lost her sporting
spirit,” Madeline rejoiced. “She’s the same old
Betty Wales, better late than never, and quite
capable of looking out for herself, as well as for
all the bothering jobs and charities and incompetent
friends and touchy millionaires and
insistent suitors and helpful ideas and noble
ambitions that clutch at her with octopus
fingers and threaten to drag her down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“Don’t talk like a book, Madeline,” Mary
criticized. “And don’t be too cock-sure that
you’re right. Just because Betty couldn’t
stand it another minute and has rushed to
cover, so to speak, in our midst, I for one refuse
to be convinced that she doesn’t need help
in fighting the octopus.”</p>

<p>Betty brushed a rebellious curl out of her
eyes with a tired little gesture, and stared curiously
at the disputants. “What in the world
are you talking about?” she demanded.
“Mary dear, please explain, because Madeline’s
explanations usually just mix things up more
than ever.”</p>

<p>Mary explained, noisily assisted by all the
other B. C. A.’s, including Madeline, who
“explained” at length how forgiving she was
by nature, advised Mary to adopt the proud
peacock as her sacred bird, and finally demanded
of Betty if she—Madeline—hadn’t
been perfectly correct in saying that she—Betty—was
perfectly capable of getting along
all right, if only she was not hampered by one
more bother,—the unasked advice and assistance
of the B. C. A.’s.</p>

<p>“Of course you’re right, Madeline,” Betty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
assured her, stirring her tea absently and forgetting
to eat any of her muffin. “I detest
people who can’t get along alone. It’s silly to
try to do a lot more than you can, and then
expect somebody to come along and take it off
your hands. I hope I’m not that kind.”
Betty dropped her spoon with a clatter, and,
sitting up very straight, faced the table with a
tragic look in her eyes and a desperate, determined
set to her soft red lips.</p>

<p>“Girls,” she began, with a sudden change
of tone that matched her changed expression,
“can you remember solid geometry? I can’t.
I never did know anything about Latin prose,
so there’s no reason why I should now. But
not knowing the geometry worries me. I
think it’s getting on my nerves. And then,”
she went on, as the little circle only stared at
her in curious silence, “Marie’s lit. notes are
just a mess. Mine were too, and anyhow I’ve
lost my note-book. Is yours here, Helen?
Could I take it, and Christy’s? I’m sure I
could manage if I had a decent note-book
or two.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of clear and lucid explanations——”
began Madeline slowly. Then she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
reached across the table to hug Betty comfortingly.
“You shall have all the decent note-books
in 19—, if you want them, you poor
thing. And I’m truly sorry that mine isn’t
one of them. As for solid geometry, I’ll
wager that not a person in this crowd
could demonstrate—is that the right word for
it?—a single proposition. And as for Latin
prose, it’s a gift from the gods. You can’t
learn it. Even Professor Owen, who is a
genius, can’t teach it. So stop worrying here
and now, and eat that muffin before somebody
is tempted beyond what she can bear, and a
theft is committed in our midst.”</p>

<p>“Is all this trouble caused by Montana
Marie O’Toole?” inquired Christy practically.</p>

<p>Betty nodded, being too busy with the muffin
to speak.</p>

<p>“Then,” Mary announced with decision,
“what she needs is three regular graduate
tutors, who specialize in lit., math., and
Latin prose, and who will come to her rescue
at any hour or hours of the day or night, at
about one-fifty per.”</p>

<p>Betty swallowed a mouthful hastily, to say,
“They wouldn’t help her any, Mary. They’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
give up in despair after about one lesson.
She’s not stupid exactly, but she’s poorly prepared,
and her mind is—well, queer. Besides,
I promised President Wallace. I agreed
to ‘undertake’ her, as Mrs. O’Toole calls it,
before he agreed to let her enter with so
many conditions. She’s going to be positively
broken-hearted if she fails at mid-years, and
I think”—Betty hesitated—“I don’t think
President Wallace will ever have any use for
me again if she does. And I am busy with
other things, and I never did know Latin prose,
and—I’m about in despair.” Betty paused
abruptly and attacked the remains of the muffin
as if the eating of it would work a magic
cure of all her woes.</p>

<p>“Betty,” asked Rachel after a minute, “does
this freshman try? Does she want to get
through enough to work for it?”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t know how to really work,
Rachel, but she tries as hard as she can. She
is awfully sweet and awfully sorry about
making extra trouble. And of course you all
understand,” Betty blushed a little, “that I’m
being paid—altogether too much, I thought
when they offered it—for looking after her.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Betty laughed suddenly. “Did you hear
about her Mountain Day exploit? I had to
speak to her about that, of course, to tell her
that she mustn’t wear a magenta handkerchief,
and shout so loud on the public highway,
and otherwise make herself too conspicuous.
And instead of being huffy, she thanked
me and sent me violets. Oh, she’s a dear!
She’s worth a lot of trouble, only I’m not
bright enough to tutor her, and the regular
ones would be sure to get provoked or discouraged
at her queer ways, and just consider her
hopeless, and let her drift along, and finally
be flunked out at mid-years.”</p>

<p>“She ought to be flunked out, oughtn’t
she?” inquired Helen Adams acutely. “I
mean, she probably can’t ever keep her work up
to the required standard without a lot of help.”</p>

<p>Betty admitted sadly that she never could.
“But she needs the life here, Helen, almost
more than any girl who ever came to Harding.
And if I can help her to have a year or two
of it, I shall,—as long as she keeps on trying
to do her part.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course,” agreed Helen uncertainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Is she in your freshman division, Helen?”
demanded Mary Brooks, after a whispered
conference with Babbie. “I judged not.
Very well then. You are hereby elected to
coach her in lit. No rule against a faculty’s
doing a little friendly tutoring, is there? My
husband hasn’t condescended to bother with
any since he got to be head of his department,
but before that——” Mary finished the explanation
with a wave of her hand. “In the
theme-work that goes with lit., Madeline is
hereby elected to come to the front. Madeline,
I presume you forgot, when you were talking
about solid geometry, that our clever little
Christy here has given up her faculty job to
take a Ph. D. in math. She is hereby elected
to assist Miss O’Toole to the comprehension
of sines and co-sines, and so forth—or do sines
and co-sines belong to trig.? And for Latin
prose,” Mary’s beamish smile broke out radiantly,
“of course you don’t know it, because
it happened before your day, but Latin prose
happens to be the one useful thing I ever
learned. I say useful, because after all these
years, I can use my one small scholarly accomplishment.
Oh, I’ve kept it up! George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
Garrison Hinsdale has seen to that. Whenever
he seems to be getting a bit tired of my
frivolous appearance and conversation, I read
him a little out of Horace or Juvenal or
Cicero’s letters, and he’s so proud of me that
I wish I had more scholarly accomplishments.
Only,”—Mary smiled serenely,—“he
says he likes me just as I am. And so, being
the Perfect Wife, I will now turn into the Perfect
Tutor, and get Marie Montana O’Toole
through her Latin prose.”</p>

<p>“The business of this meeting having been
disposed of,” Madeline took up the tale, “I
hereby demand that we begin to celebrate in
honor of me and my forthcoming novel.”</p>

<p>“And to discuss wedding dates,” added
Babbie, “in honor of me and my Young-Man-Over-the-Fence.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think,” suggested Rachel, “that
first we’d better let Betty, who has just said
she prefers to manage her own affairs, say
what she wants to do about Mary’s elections?”</p>

<p>“When you are elected——” began Mary,
but Helen, Rachel, and Christy, the serious
members, silenced her.</p>

<p>“Now, Betty,” ordered Rachel. Betty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
looked solemnly from Helen to Christy, from
Christy to Madeline, and finally at Mary.</p>

<p>“Would you really do it, girls?” she asked
at last.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Helen quietly.</p>

<p>“You can count on me, if you want me,”
Christy told her.</p>

<p>“I can’t promise till I’ve looked over the
freshman,” Madeline qualified. “If she is
anywhere near as interesting as she sounds,
I’ll ‘undertake’ her theme-work with much
pleasure.”</p>

<p>“I’m simply dying to display my one
accomplishment,” Mary declared feelingly.</p>

<p>Betty gave a long, happy sigh. “Then of
course I want you all to help,” she said. “I
was just about in despair when I came rushing
down here. And now—you’re not regular
tutors. You understand things. You know
how I feel—and how Prexy feels. I couldn’t
explain to a regular tutor that for some unknown
reason Prexy cares a lot about Marie’s
passing her exams. And I couldn’t tell them
why she herself needs so much to stay on
here. But you’ll see it all. Oh, dear! I’m
so happy!” Betty crunched one of Cousin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Kate’s cookies, and smiled radiantly at Mary,
who had “elected” everything so beautifully.</p>

<p>“Well,” inquired Babbie, after a polite
interval, “now can we begin to celebrate and
plan weddings?”</p>

<p>“Easily,” Mary Brooks assured her. “Only
don’t forget, all of you, whether you have
been elected tutors yet or whether you haven’t,
that you’ve each and all got to help. The B.
C. A.’s have adopted a new object—we have
undertaken Montana Marie O’Toole—and it
may need our entire combined effort to make
her a credit to us and to Harding. But we’ve
got to do it. And do it we will!”</p>

<p>“Hear! Hear!” from Madeline.</p>

<p>“The B. C. A.’s to the Rescue!” cried
Helen.</p>

<p>“Betty Wales and her freshman!” added
Christy.</p>

<p>They drank the toasts with much enthusiasm
in fresh cups of tea—poured out without
the use of a strainer, because the next “feature”
on the program was to be tea-ground
fortunes all around, read by that past-mistress
of the fine art of making everything interesting,
Miss Madeline Ayres.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>THE INTERVENTION OF JIM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Montana Marie O’Toole</span> accepted with her
accustomed submissive sweetness the new
tutors “elected” to office by Mary Brooks
Hinsdale and tactfully introduced to their
victim by Betty Wales, who explained just
why she had consented to a division of labor.</p>

<p>“They do seem to make me understand
better,” Marie told Betty, a few days after the
beginning of the new régime. “That Miss
Mason is awfully smart, isn’t she? But fortunately
she isn’t anything like that smart
tutor I had last summer. Miss Mason makes
me puzzle things out for myself. It takes a
lot of her valuable time, I’m afraid.” Poor
Marie sighed deeply. “It’s a great responsibility,
wasting the time of a faculty and a—what’s
that Miss Mason is?—oh, yes, a Fellow
in Mathematics. And I can’t pay Miss
Adams, because it is against the rules for the
faculty to be paid for tutoring. Is it against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
the rules for me to send her flowers every day,
Miss Wales?”</p>

<p>Betty remembered how violets used to make
Helen’s eyes shine, and said no. “Only you
mustn’t be extravagant, you know. Every
day is much too often to send flowers.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say that I think it’s any too often
to get flowers,” smiled Montana Marie. “And
so far Pa hasn’t objected to any of my bills.
It’s fortunate, isn’t it, that my father isn’t as
poor as I am stupid?”</p>

<p>“You’re not stupid,” Betty encouraged her.
“If you’ll only keep on trying——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall keep trying.” Montana Marie
was firm as a rock on that point. “I’ve inherited
my father’s stick-to-itiveness, if I
haven’t inherited his brains. Now I might
have been a flyaway like Ma. And in that
case things would have been pretty hopeless,
wouldn’t they, Miss Wales?”</p>

<p>Two days later Montana Marie appeared at
Betty’s office, the fire of determination in her
lovely eyes.</p>

<p>“I saw a sign on the bulletin-board that
said there was an unexpected vacancy in Morton
Hall. Is that so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Betty nodded abstractedly, her finger on the
place where she had left off reading a letter
from Mr. Morton.</p>

<p>“Then I want to fill it. I’ve got to leave
the Vincent Arms because it’s too diverting to
my mind. If I could live in the dormitory
with you, I should be made!”</p>

<p>“But Morton Hall is a special dormitory,”
Betty explained patiently, as she had many
times before, to admirers who had thought it
would be the making of them to live in “her
dormitory.” “And you’re not eligible.” She
went into details. “So you can’t possibly
come, and if you could I don’t think you’d
like it. The harder a person works the more
she needs recreation. But most of my girls
have had too much work and too little play
all their lives long. They don’t know how to
play the way Georgia Ames and Miss Hart
and the Duttons do. You’d find them dull
after the others.”</p>

<p>“Then in that case my mind would stay
right on my work. I’m just the opposite
from them, Miss Wales. I’ve had too much
play and too little work all my life until
now. They say opposites attract, so I’m sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
I should get along splendidly with those
girls.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not eligible,” Betty repeated.</p>

<p>Montana Marie considered that. “Suppose
no poor girl wants to come in just at present,”
she suggested at last. “Moving in the middle
of the term is a bother, isn’t it? Don’t most
girls promise to keep their rooms right through
the term or even for the whole year? Couldn’t
I have the room as long as it is empty,—just
until some eligible girl wants it?”</p>

<p>Montana Marie didn’t mind moving in,
with the strong probability of having to move
out again very soon; she had lived in trunks
and hotels most of her life, and was used to
picking up at a moment’s notice whenever her
flyaway mother got tired of eating Swiss
honey, or buying Dutch silver, or studying
German art, and decided to move on.</p>

<p>The vacant room that Betty had advertised
on the bulletin-board was a third floor single,
but when the Thorn, who shared one of Morton
Hall’s few doubles, begged quite pathetically
for a chance to room alone, Betty had not
the heart to refuse her. Secretly, too, she was
relieved at the prospect of thus finally settling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the question of Montana Marie’s coming into
the house; for in spite of her protégée’s excellent
logic, Betty doubted the wisdom of
mixing such alien elements as Montana Marie
and the Morton Hall girls, and if anybody
suffered from the situation she felt sure it
would not be the exuberant Montana Marie,
with a mind of her own and a genius for getting
what she wanted. Still Marie had been
thoroughly in earnest in wanting to find a
boarding place where she could study without
interruption. Betty broke the news to her
gently.</p>

<p>“Matilda Thorn’s—I mean Matilda Jones’s
roommate,” she explained, “is a funny little
junior from Corey Corners, New Hampshire.
She taught a district school for two years, to
earn money enough to justify her in beginning
her college course. In the summers she is
waitress in one of the big White Mountain
hotels, not far from where she lives, and she
usually earns a little extra by taking care of
some rich woman’s children when their nurse
wants a holiday or an evening off.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie listened intently. “She
must know how to concentrate her mind, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
she does all that. I should think she’d be an
ideal roommate for me, shouldn’t you, Miss
Wales? But maybe she won’t like me.
Could you arrange to have us meet, Miss
Wales, and then you could ask her to say
honestly what she thought, and if she didn’t
object to me I could move in right away.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie’s calm determination to look
on the bright side of things took the wind out
of Betty’s opposition, just as, a little later, her
radiant, magnetic charm won from the rather
washed-out, nervous junior from Corey Corners
an eager assent to Betty’s proposal.
Montana Marie, five trunks, a Mexican saddle
and a striped Parisian hat-box containing a
hat that was too big for any compartment in
the pigskin hat trunk, appeared without loss
of time at Morton Hall. Being systematic,
Montana Marie immediately set to work at
disposing of her possessions within the limited
area of half a rather small room and half a
very small closet. After an hour’s work and
ten minutes’ thoughtful contemplation, she invited
her new roommate, who was trying to
write an argument paper, to go down-town
and help find a carpenter. The roommate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
compromised by telling Marie where the best
carpenter in Harding was to be found, and
Marie went off happily. A minute later she
reappeared with a question.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have him make me a box to
go under my bed. Do you keep things under
your bed? You don’t? Then do you mind if
I have him make two boxes? I have such a
silly lot of clothes. Oh, thank you so much.
You’re the nicest roommate! Sure there are
no errands I can do for you?”</p>

<p>Without looking up from her work, the
strenuous little junior said no to that, for at
least the third time; but when Marie presented
her with a box of chocolates, evidently as a reward
for being obliging about the bed-box, she
relaxed her Spartan discipline and ate so
much candy that she had indigestion, and was
compelled to finish her argument paper in a
style far inferior to that in which she had begun
it. This adventure made her wary, and
however easily the rest of Morton Hall fell
into Montana Marie’s enticing snares, her
roommate kept aloof. Her name was Cordelia
Payson, but Montana Marie always referred to
her by Fluffy Dutton’s title, “The Concentrating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Influence,” which Straight Dutton
shortened, for her own and others’ convenience,
to “Connie.”</p>

<p>The carpenter recommended by “Connie”
duly produced two bed-boxes, after Montana
Marie’s design, which included castors, brass
handles for pulling them out and lifting the
covers, and interior upholstery of pale blue
satin, violet-scented. When they were delivered,
Montana Marie again attacked the
problem of emptying the five trunks which had
effectively blocked the hallway since her arrival.
When she had done her best with the
bed-boxes, there was still a trunkful of dresses
to dispose of. Montana Marie again spent
ten minutes in contemplation, and then
sallied forth to order a closet pole arranged on
a pulley, and equipped with two dozen dress-hangers.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep it up in that waste space under
the ceiling,” she explained to the Concentrating
Influence. “I’ll hang my evening dresses
on it, and things I don’t like and seldom wear.
When I want to let it down, it won’t kill me
to empty out part of the closet on to some
chairs. Otherwise,”—Montana Marie surveyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
the tightly wedged mass of clothes
cheerfully,—“otherwise I’m afraid it wouldn’t
plough through that mass and drop down.
I’ve got too many things, that’s evident.
When mid-years are over and I have a little
time to turn around in, I’ll sort them out and
get rid of all but what I strictly need. And
then,” she giggled cheerfully, “it will be time
to get a lot of new clothes for spring. I love
spring clothes, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to finish reading this book to-night,”
the Concentrating Influence told her
primly, planting her elbows on her desk, and
stuffing her fingers into her ears.</p>

<p>“Oh, excuse me,” begged Montana Marie
contritely. “I’m a dreadful bother. I talk
too much. When you finish the book, could
you show me a little about these originals that
come after the twenty-sixth proposition?”</p>

<p>The Concentrating Influence had not forgotten
her solid geometry. With casual assistance
from her, and the definite and determined
help of Mary Brooks Hinsdale and her
corps of selected tutors, Montana Marie was
making some slight progress. Betty’s part
was to keep Marie fully impressed with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
slightness of the progress and the need for keeping
up all of her work instead of letting part
slide while she devoted herself to the mastery
of one particularly troublesome subject; also
to preach her tactful little sermons about the
rights of roommates who were too obliging to
object to being imposed upon. After one of
these lectures Montana Marie always presented
the Concentrating Influence with candy or
flowers in absurdly generous quantities.</p>

<p>But it was not the candy and flowers that
made the junior from Corey Corners feel as if,
after having “scraped along” for years, she
had suddenly begun to live. It was Montana
Marie’s unconscious assumption that she, Cordelia
Payson, was a wonderful person, that all
Harding College thought so, that girls like
Georgia Ames and the Duttons and even that
snobbish Eugenia Ford had noticed how well
she did in argument, had been sorry she
didn’t “make” the class hockey team, and
had wished they knew her better.</p>

<p>Montana Marie could not help saying pleasant
things; she had been educated to do so.
She could not help admiring mental concentration;
Betty Wales had talked nothing else<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
to her all the year and “Connie” illustrated all
Betty’s points as perfectly as if she had been
created for no other purpose.</p>

<p>So it was small credit to Montana Marie that
she made Cordelia Payson happy. Neither
was it at all to her credit that she was instrumental
in bringing Jim Watson hot-foot to
Harding to investigate the supposedly prevailing
dissatisfaction with Morton Hall, and incidentally
to give the overworked Betty Wales
two splendid, all-the-afternoon rides, and, in
addition, the restful feeling that she was being
looked after by a resourceful and a resolute
young man.</p>

<p>It all came about in this way. One day
when Marie had finished a Latin lesson with
Mrs. Hinsdale, that lady walked back to
the campus with her pupil on the way to a
reception in town. Mary inquired solicitously
for Betty, whom she had not seen for several
days.</p>

<p>“She’s all right, I guess,” explained Marie
easily. “Only she’s sort of absent-minded,
and I notice that she doesn’t eat much.”</p>

<p>“She’s overdoing dreadfully,” sighed Mary.</p>

<p>Montana Marie considered. “As far as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
have noticed I should say that a person feels
better for working hard. Ma does nothing,
and Pa never takes a vacation, and he’s a lot
stronger than Ma is, and happier. But work
is one thing, and worry is another,” sighed
Marie. “Worrying uses a person up like anything.
Maybe Miss Wales has something on
her mind. Who is this Mr. Jim Watson that
you all tease her about, Mrs. Hinsdale?”</p>

<p>Mary explained, with a dignity that was
quite lost on Montana Marie, about Jim and
Eleanor, Jim and Morton Hall, and Jim and
Betty.</p>

<p>“Wonder if she’d like to see him,” speculated
Marie. “She seemed awfully cheerful
when I saw her in the summer, right after
he’d been in Cleveland. For my part I
should certainly like to see him.” Marie
sighed again. “I get so sick of having
no men to talk to—not even faculty men.
Every single one of my divisions recites to a
woman.”</p>

<p>That night Montana Marie let her mind
wander shamefully from math., lit., and
Latin prose. At last her contemplative smile
flashed out into sudden, mischievous brilliancy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
Selecting a sheet of her best lavender-tinted,
violet-scented note-paper, she
covered it rapidly with her sprawling, unformed
characters, and directed it to Mr.
James Watson, in care of his firm, the name
of which she had fortunately remembered
from Mary’s recital.</p>

<p>Two days later Jim Watson, grinning sheepishly,
stuck his head, in his accustomed furtive
fashion, in at Betty’s office door. Finding
only one small person, with curls and a
dimple, in the office, Jim came in a little
further, and stood awaiting developments,
grinning now much more cheerfully.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you doing here?”
demanded Betty breathlessly, jumping up to
shake hands.</p>

<p>Jim strolled over to the desk. “Don’t get
up.” He sat down solemnly in the visitors’
chair. “Don’t you really know why I’m
here?”</p>

<p>“No-o,” gasped Betty, dreadfully afraid
of what might be coming next. “But I know
something else. You ought to be hard at
work in New York.”</p>

<p>“I have come,” Jim began very solemnly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
“to investigate serious charges brought against
the efficiency of the architects, particularly
the resident architect-in-charge, of Morton
Hall. My first duty is naturally to ascertain
whether you are personally convinced of the
truth of said charges. We aim to please.”
Jim grinned again. “Particularly, to please
one small secretary, with curls and a dimple,
and a lot too much to do.”</p>

<p>Betty leaned back in her big chair and
wrinkled her face into a delightful, childlike,
all-over smile. “Please explain, Jim. It’s
mean to tease a person like me that can’t ever
see through it.”</p>

<p>Jim frowned, a portentous, businesslike
frown. “Haven’t I made myself clear, Miss
Secretary?” He fumbled in his pockets, and
produced with a flourish Montana Marie’s
lavender-tinted, violet-scented, scrawling note.
“I got this communication yesterday, and I
came right up to see about it.” He handed
the note to Betty.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<i>Mr. James Watson</i>,<br>
“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>“You didn’t do a very good job on
Morton Hall. There is a lot of waste space<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
under the ceilings of the closets. They are
also too small. So are the double rooms.
The halls are too narrow when there are trunks
around. I have fixed my closet. I think it
would help you in your work to see how I
did it.</p>

<p>“Miss Wales, whom I believe you know,
acts rather tired these days.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright2">“Yours respectfully,</span><br>
<span class="indentright">“<span class="smcap">Marie O’Toole</span>,</span><br>
“A Morton Hallite.”</p>
</div>

<p>Betty puzzled out Marie’s hieroglyphics
slowly, read the note through again, and
sighed despairingly, “What will that girl do
next?” Then she laughed till the tears
came. Then she turned severely upon Jim.</p>

<p>“You could see that it was all nonsense.
Why in the world did you bother to come
rushing up here on account of a piece of foolishness
like that?”</p>

<p>Jim only grinned. “I wanted to meet
Miss Marie O’Toole of Morton Hall,” he announced
calmly. “Have you any objections?”
Then he went on, in a different tone,
“I say, Betty, be a good fellow, and let’s go
riding after lunch. I’m feeling a bit stale,—honestly
I am. An office-man like me ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
never to have been brought up on ranches.
If I hadn’t acquired the fresh-air-and-exercise
habit when I was a kid, I might be able to
make a reputation now. But I can’t stick to
a desk long enough.”</p>

<p>“Miss O’Toole will ride with you, poor tired
man,” laughed Betty. “She comes from the
West, too, and she rides like an Amazon, so
she’ll give you all the exercise you want,
trying to keep up with her.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Jim briefly. “I prefer you.
Say yes, Betty, like a lady, and I’ll clear
right out and let you do a morning’s work in
peace.”</p>

<p>Betty hesitated and was lost.</p>

<p>“At two then,” Jim sang back gaily as he
“cleared out.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_112">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“I’VE PASSED OFF MY ENTRANCE LATIN”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Five minutes later Montana Marie appeared
in Betty’s office looking particularly radiant.
“I just stopped in to tell you that I’ve passed
off my entrance Latin,” she said. “I knew
you’d be glad——” Her eyes fell on the
lavender-tinted note, which Jim had forgotten
to recover, and she flushed guiltily.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t have done such a thing,”
Betty told her severely, as her glance followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
Marie’s. “Mr. Watson has just been here.
He thought—he wanted——” Betty stopped
short, and her merry laughter rang out so loud
that the psychology class, which was reciting
next door, heard it and wondered.</p>

<p>“Mr. Watson will be at the Morton for
dinner to-night,” Betty began again, smiling
this time, “so be sure not to go out anywhere,
because I shall need you to help entertain
him.”</p>

<p>“I guess you don’t need me,” beamed
Montana Marie. “I rather guess not! But
I’ll be there. You can count on that, Miss
Wales. I—I’m sorry if I’ve bothered you,
but——” Marie stopped and slipped softly
out, for Betty was not listening. With a shining,
far-away look in her eyes, and a smile on
her lips, she was thinking of—something else.</p>

<p>“I’m not sorry,—not a bit sorry,” murmured
Montana Marie, hurrying off to her
next class. She did not refer to the fact that,
by delaying too long in Betty’s office, she had
made herself late again—the second time that
week—for freshman math.</p>

<small>BINKS AMES MAKES A DISCOVERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">“Binks” Ames</span>, otherwise Elizabeth B.
Browning Ames and first cousin to Georgia,
was now a sophomore. Being a strenuous
little person and addicted to walks in all
weather, she had grown even thinner and
browner than she had been as a freshman.
When she timidly discovered a friend in a
crowd of girls she did not know and flashed
her a friendly greeting, Binks seemed to be
all wonderful big gray eyes and wonderful
sweet sympathy.</p>

<p>“Binks is peculiar,” Georgia explained her
tersely. “Couldn’t help that, could she, with
a mother who goes in for Browning and Municipal
Improvement and Suffrage and the Uplifting
of the Drama and all such nonsense?
Binks is lovely to her—pretends to take an
interest in all her isms, and bluffs about
understanding Robert Browning and Henry
James, and about liking her name. But it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
all bluff. Binks is just as sensible as I am,
and lots and lots more—decent,” ended the
unsentimental Georgia. “Takes home stray
cats, you know, and goes walking with freaks,—and
doesn’t mind the bother. I never in
all my life set eyes on as many stray cats as
Binks finds homes for in a good average week.
Of course Esther Bond is her big discovery.
She was responsible for getting Esther into
the Morton, you know, and since then Esther
has mysteriously developed into the biggest
all-around Senior Star that we’ve got.”</p>

<p>“Really?” asked Straight. “That queer
Miss Bond?”</p>

<p>Georgia nodded solemnly. “Jumped into
things like that.” She flashed out a capable
hand. “Argus board, Senior Play Committee,
and I guess Ivy Orator. Of course Helena
Mason’s dropping out gave Esther an extra-good
chance to step in, but it’s wonderful all
the same. It must be lots of fun to be a perfectly
Dark Horse like her. People would be
so agreeably surprised that they’d appreciate
you even more than you deserve.”</p>

<p>“Instead of wondering how in the world a
commonplace girl like Georgia Ames ever got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
to be so popular,” mimicked Fluffy, the
tease.</p>

<p>“I say, Georgia,” demanded Straight, who
liked college because it offered her the chance
of knowing such a variety of people, and so
of satisfying every mood, and developing
every trait of her own complex character.
“If you’ve got a cousin as clever as all that,
why don’t you let us meet her? I don’t believe
I ever so much as heard of her before.
We ought to be looking up the eligible sophs,
you know. Dramatic Club’s first sophomore
election isn’t so very far off. Is Elizabeth B.
B. Ames a possibility?”</p>

<p>Georgia gave a little start of surprise.
“Why, I don’t know. Honestly I never
thought of her as one, and yet compared to
some girls that are being rushed and discussed,
and to some that are expecting it—you see,
Binks is—well, different. I can’t imagine her
in Dramatic Club. She’s so queer that she
might actually refuse to come in.”</p>

<p>“You said she was just as sensible as you
are, Georgia,” Fluffy reminded her. “That’s
not so much—but at least you didn’t refuse
Dramatic Club.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“Have a tea-drinking and let us see her,”
Straight settled the controversy briskly. “I
for one want to see her. Come along now or
we shall be late for the hockey.”</p>

<p>A few days later Georgia, finding a free
half-hour on her hands, went over to the
Westcott House to see Binks. Not having
paid much attention to the college career of
her peculiar cousin from Boston, Georgia was
surprised and pleased to find said cousin’s
room full of a departing House Play Committee,
who were loud in their praises of Binks’s
ability.</p>

<p>“It’s only that I sew costumes for them,”
Binks explained when they had gone, leaving
the room still fairly full of gilt crowns, ermine
robes, and foresters’ doublets and hose of
Lincoln green. “I love to sew, only I don’t
know how very well.”</p>

<p>Georgia surveyed her cousin critically.
“Should you like to belong to Dramatic
Club?” she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Binks smoothed out a bit of purple canton
flannel that looked exactly like velvet with
loving little pats. “I don’t know. Do you
belong? Is it fun?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“I belong,” Georgia told her, “and I think
it’s fun, but I suppose some people might
not—if they were queer enough in their
tastes.”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing like any of Mother’s clubs,
is it?” inquired Binks anxiously. “I don’t
care about that kind of fun—writing papers,
and speaking to the legislature about changing
laws, and all that.”</p>

<p>“Binks Ames,” began Georgia solemnly,
“don’t you honestly know more than you’re
pretending to about Dramatic Club? Because
if you don’t you ought to join for
your own good and to learn a little something
about college life.”</p>

<p>Binks smiled vaguely. “I don’t seem to
have time to do all the things you do, Georgia.
You see, I have to specialize in economics to
please Mother, and in history to please Father,
and in astronomy to please myself. And then
there are so many queer girls that I get mixed
up with, as I did with Esther Bond and Miss
Ellison—the poetess person. She is forever
taking me for walks and spouting poems to me
all the way. I tell her that I don’t know anything
about poetry, but either she doesn’t believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
me or she can’t find any one else who
will listen.”</p>

<p>“No reason why she should bother you,”
grumbled Georgia, who began to think that
Binks might be worth cultivating.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes it is,” Binks told her seriously.
“You see, she believes in her poetry, and I
guess it is all right enough. Anyway, if she
stopped believing in it, she would be too discouraged
to go on trying to write it. So if I
can keep her going until she’s sure one way
or the other, why, it’s little enough for a general
utility person like me to do.”</p>

<p>Georgia sniffed. “I hope some of the
numerous geniuses that have sponged on you
will amount to something,—and that some of
the cats you have picked up will take prizes at
Cat Shows.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t pick them up because they are
nice cats,” objected Binks solemnly, “only because
they are lost, poor things!”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget about having tea with us to-morrow,”
said Georgia, getting ready to leave.
Her half-hour was up, and besides, she hated
queer theories.</p>

<p>Binks did not forget to come for tea with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
Georgia and Georgia’s friends. She arrived
on time, and becomingly dressed. She listened
with gratifying appreciation to the sprightly
conversation kept up by Fluffy and Susanna
Hart, with some help from the others. She
talked enough to be agreeable, and not enough
to seem overanxious to make a favorable impression
on the leading spirits of Dramatic
Club, who could “make” her career at Harding,
if they thought it worth while to include
her in the enchanted company of the
sophomores who “went in” at the first sophomore
election.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Binks did not know that
the tea-drinkers all belonged to Dramatic
Club. She did not guess why she had been
asked to the tea-drinking. She had indeed
entirely forgotten Dramatic Club, and had
never given a second thought to Georgia’s
question about her wanting to be elected to
it.</p>

<p>Georgia, being a close observer, saw all this,
and made up her mind to work hard for
Binks’s election. Her little cousin’s extreme
unworldliness made her seem to the straightforward,
clear-headed Georgia a rather pathetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
object, to be looked out for and defended,
and secured the rights and privileges that she
herself did not know enough to demand.
And, as what Georgia said always “went”
with her large and very influential circle of
friends, Binks was promptly slated as one of
the fortunate sophomores whom Dramatic
Club was to single out as those most wanted in
its councils.</p>

<p>While this was being decided casually on
the way up the Belden House stairs, Binks was
sitting alone in her little room, staring out
with troubled eyes at a lovely wind-tossed sunset.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t have said I’d do it, I suppose,”
murmured poor Binks. “Only I hate to say
no. Georgia would call me a silly! Wish I’d
told Georgia all about it. I didn’t have any
chance to talk to her alone. But I might
have made a chance—perhaps. Georgia knows
Miss Wales better, and anyway she doesn’t
mind asking people to do things. Oh—come
in!”</p>

<p>The door opened slowly and the poetess,
looking tired and out of temper, came in. “I
wanted you to go walking,” she said reproachfully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
“I came at four as usual, and you were
out.”</p>

<p>“But yesterday I stayed in for you, and you
didn’t come at all,” explained Binks patiently.
“And I left a note on the bulletin-board about
to-day.”</p>

<p>“You know I never look at the bulletin-board,”
returned the poetess sadly.</p>

<p>“But you ought to,” began Binks, and
stopped short. “Never mind. Let’s not
bother over what’s past. Do you want to go
walking some more, or would you rather just
sit here and watch the sunset?”</p>

<p>Miss Ellison stared gloomily out the window.
“I’m too tired to walk any more. That
divan looks awfully comfortable.”</p>

<p>Binks, who was sitting on the divan, stood
up politely. “It is. Did you want to write,
perhaps? Because if so, I’ll go away.”</p>

<p>The poetess sank gracefully down among
the cushions, pillowing her cheek in one white
hand.</p>

<p>“I’ve put paper out here in plain sight,”
Binks told her, “and please try not to spill the
ink. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Don’t stay too long,” commanded the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
poetess dreamily. “I shall want to read
things to you a little later.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Binks promised, and hurried
off to find Georgia.</p>

<p>“I want to ask you to do something for me,”
she began abruptly.</p>

<p>Georgia frowned at the stupid mistake she
had made about Binks’s unworldliness, and shut
the door. “Is it about Dramatic Club?” she
asked. “Because you know, Binks,—or rather
I suppose you don’t know,—that girls are not
supposed to ask any member to help them get
in. But I don’t mind telling you that I’ll do
my best for you, and I think all the others
will.”</p>

<p>Binks waited patiently for Georgia to finish.
“I understand that, Georgia,” she began. “I
mean that I know, even though I am rather out
of things here, that it’s not Harding custom to
act as if you wanted to be in anything. You
must just pretend you don’t care. I try to act
that way, but I can’t, about things that I really
do want.”</p>

<p>Georgia looked troubled. “But, Binks, it
will queer you hopelessly if you give yourself
away about Dramatic Club. Promise me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
solemnly that you won’t ask anybody else to
help pull you in.”</p>

<p>Binks sighed. “I’ve got to go back in a
minute, and I came about something special.
Dramatic Club isn’t a thing I really do want,
Georgia. Why, I don’t know enough about it
to think whether I want it or not. But I’ve
discovered something again, and I’m such a
’fraid cat that I thought maybe you’d tell Miss
Wales—that is, if you think she ought to
know.”</p>

<p>Georgia looked hard at her queer little
cousin. “Go ahead and tell me,” she said,
after a long stare of amazed incredulity. “Go
ahead and tell me, and I’ll tell Betty, if that’s
what you want. But of all innocent, simple-minded,
dense——” Georgia paused. The
degree of Binks’s densely innocent simple-mindedness
could not be put into words.</p>

<p>“Well,” began Binks intently, without
noticing Georgia’s muttered epithets, “you
know the way I always get mixed up with
freaks—the way I did last year at the infirmary,
with Mariana Ellison, who writes——”</p>

<p>“I know—the C. P.,” interrupted Georgia
hastily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“C. P.?” repeated Binks questioningly.
“Oh, yes, the College Poet. That’s the one.
And Esther Bond was there, and a scientific
prod, named Jones.”</p>

<p>“I know—the one with the comical squint,”
put in Georgia, smiling at the recollection.</p>

<p>“Well, she’s got a sister,” went on Binks
quickly, “a freshman. They thought they
had enough money for two, with the junior
one’s scholarship and what she earns tutoring.
And then they found they hadn’t, and the
Student’s Aid doesn’t generally help freshmen.”
Binks frowned. “You can’t blame
the poor things. The junior got Miss Wales
to give her a loan, and then she passed it over
to her sister. And now after it’s gone and she
can’t pay it back, it has worried her so that
she’s about sick, and Dr. Carter wants her to
give up tutoring and get another loan to carry
her through the term.</p>

<p>“And she wouldn’t! She came to me and
told me and cried, and I said—well, I suppose
I promised to fix it up. Wasn’t that foolish,
when I can’t even explain it to you so that it
sounds plausible? Why, I’ve actually left out
both her best excuses for doing what looks so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
dishonest! One is that she could honestly
say she needed the loan herself, because she
did. She’s gone without enough to eat lots
of times this year. The other is that the
freshman is awfully bright and not very strong,
and if her uncle—— Goodness, I forgot to say
that an uncle promised to help the freshman,
and then, after she’d given up her country
school and come to Harding, he backed out.
Don’t you think there is a good deal of excuse
for her, Georgia? Of course the freshman isn’t
to blame at all, because she didn’t, and doesn’t
know where her sister got the money. There!
That’s another point I forgot to bring in in its
proper place.”</p>

<p>“You have got a rather disorderly mind,
Binks,” admitted Georgia. “You’ve entirely
left out the point that interests me most of all.
Why did Miss Jones tell you her story?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” returned Binks plaintively.
“I never know why people tell me
queer things. Of course you understand that
she had to tell somebody to get it off her
mind. And now I’ve got it off my mind, and
I must go right back home. Miss Ellison
might be waiting for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“Let her wait,” advised Georgia coolly.
“Did Miss Jones tell you to do as you
thought best with her unpleasant little tale?”</p>

<p>Binks nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, are you sure we hadn’t better just
smother it?”</p>

<p>Binks’s small face took on a curiously scornful
expression. “Of course we hadn’t better
smother it. She told me, so that I’d tell the
right ones and have it fixed right, so that
she can feel honest again. You see,”—she
sighed—“those freaks always think that I
will know how to fix things—and I never
do know. But I can find out,” added Binks
serenely. “I’m bright enough to do that.
Only it is an unpleasant story, and you know
Miss Wales, and how to tell it to her right.
I think—I’m sure you’d better tell her,
Georgia, if you’ll be so kind.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Georgia. “Betty’s undoubtedly
the one to handle it. I’ll see
her some time to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, Georgia.” Binks glanced
anxiously at her watch and slipped on her
ulster. “Perhaps I can do something for you
some day. I do wish I could.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“Nonsense,” said Georgia bluffly. “I’m
not doing anything. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye.” Binks paused uncertainly on
the threshold. “I forgot to say that I don’t
think the freshman sister should stay on here,
even if she had the money. I think she is
really ill.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Carter thinks so, you mean?” asked
Georgia.</p>

<p>“Dr. Carter hasn’t seen her. I think so
myself. Mother is great on germs, you know,
and I’ve learned to notice when people look
ill. The freshman sister is pale and thin,
and she coughs just a little, and she works on
her nerves—much too hard. She ought to live
outdoors for a while and get rested up and fed
up. And if she would do that, why perhaps
Mother would know of a free sanitorium that
takes in—whatever she has. I must go now.”</p>

<p>Little Binks hurried eagerly off to conciliate
the impatient poetess, leaving Georgia to
meditate upon her peculiar cousin and the
pathetic story she had told.</p>

<p>“To have people think you’re not honest!”
reflected Georgia. “I remember something
about that from my freshman year. It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
pretty bad. But to know yourself that you
haven’t been honest—that must be just perfectly
dreadful. Poor thing! In a way it
was all right, too. That makes it even
harder. And it’s abominably hard not to
have any of the things that most girls have
here so much too much of. Why, that squint
of hers is enough to make her think crooked,
and be discontented with life! And if the
sister is so done up that she has to leave,
then the dishonesty will have been all for
nothing. Poor Betty! She won’t think I’m
much of a rescuer when I dump this bundle
of bothers into her nice, comfortable lap.”</p>

<small>JISTS AND SUFFRAGISTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">You</span> can get a thing off your mind easily
enough by telling it to somebody,” said little
Binks Ames very soberly. “But it isn’t so
easy to get it off your heart. I don’t know
how to begin, and I hate to bother you and
Miss Wales any more, Georgia, but something
has simply got to be done for that poor freshman
Jones.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t your mother know of any free sanitorium?”
demanded Georgia.</p>

<p>Binks shook her head. “It costs seven
dollars a week at the one she ought to go to,
and she’d probably have to stay a year. Seven
times two is fourteen and seven times five
is—— Oh, dear, I can’t do it in my head!”</p>

<p>“Three sixty-four,” computed Georgia rapidly.
“More than it would probably cost her
to stay on here for a year. And that was
more than she’s got. Can’t she get well at
home?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“Maybe,” said Binks absently, “but she’s a
lot surer to at the sanitorium. Georgia, you
remember the day you asked me for tea at the
Tally-ho? It was full, and everybody seemed
to be having a good deal to eat. Your bill
for six—I couldn’t help seeing it—was two
dollars and ten cents.”</p>

<p>“It was,” said Georgia, “and I had to borrow
the ten cents of Fluffy Dutton. Why
will you unkindly recall that embarrassing
incident, Binks?”</p>

<p>Binks smiled politely at Georgia’s little
joke. “I was just thinking—if that tea-shop
is full every afternoon, and each girl
spends thirty or forty cents for tea and cakes,
why, in a week they must pay out nearly
three hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“Easily,” agreed Georgia. “And incidentally
they ruin their digestions and their
appetites for campus dinners, and we have to
eat warmed-up left-overs for next day’s lunch.
But Betty Wales and her tea-shop flourish,
and everybody is happy.”</p>

<p>“I was wondering,” went on Binks soberly,
“if the girls wouldn’t be glad to give away
more than they do, if they could see that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
was really needed. Forty cents for tea doesn’t
mean anything to most of them. Now
wouldn’t they give forty cents each to help
Miss Jones get well?”</p>

<p>Georgia shook her head slowly. “No,
because it’s not amusing. Tea and cakes,
ordered off stunty menus, served among the
extra-special features of the Tally-ho, with
your little pals beside you, and a senior you’re
crazy about at the next table—that’s forty
cents’ worth of fun, or four hundred cents’
worth, if you happen to have it. But when
you’re asked to give away forty cents, it looks
as big and as precious as forty dollars. It
seems as if it would buy all the things you
want, and as if, when it was gone, you’d
never see another forty cents as good as that
one.”</p>

<p>Georgia paused triumphantly, and Binks
sighed acquiescence. “All right. You know
how things are here, Georgia, and I don’t.
They won’t give the money to Miss Jones, but
they’d spend it fast enough at an amusing
benefit performance for her. Is that what
you mean, Georgia?”</p>

<p>Georgia smiled pleasantly. “No, I didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
mean that, but it’s true, now that you mention it.
You’re too rapid for me, Binks. I
didn’t know you were such a rusher. But
you go right ahead with your show—that’s
the Harding term for an amusing benefit performance—and
I will stay behind and attend
to such practical details as time, place, and the
kind permission of the faculty, also the valued
approval and assistance of Miss B. Wales.
Blood will tell, Binks. You’re going into
this thing with all Aunt Caroline’s fine
enthusiasm for good works.”</p>

<p>“That freshman Jones is so pathetic,” said
Binks simply. “If she was my sister I
presume I should steal, if necessary, to get
her what she needed.”</p>

<p>“Gracious, Binks!” protested Georgia.
“You sound like a dangerous anarchist.”</p>

<p>“Well, fortunately she’s not my sister,”
Binks reassured her cousin, “so I can just
help get up a show for her. What kind of a
show would it better be, Georgia?”</p>

<p>Georgia laughed. “You speak as if shows
grew on bushes, Binks, and we could pick off
any kind we liked the looks of. Whereas the
sad fact is that we shall have to snatch joyously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
at any kind we can think of—if we’re lucky
enough to think of a kind.”</p>

<p>“A suffrage bazaar would be rather nice,
wouldn’t it?” Binks suggested casually.
“It would be comical all right, if it was anything
like the real ones. Suffragettes are
certainly funny, and antis are even funnier.”</p>

<p>“Sort of a take-off on the strenuous female,
you mean?” inquired Georgia.</p>

<p>Binks nodded. “We could have speeches
and a play, if anybody could write one, or
maybe a mock trial, and then everybody
could vote on the suffrage question. Women’s
colleges are always voting on suffrage nowadays.
They seem to like it.”</p>

<p>“That’s good, so far,” Georgia agreed approvingly.
“Why not satirize a few other
feminine fads while you’re in the business?
I can think of a lovely parody on æsthetic
dancing. My mother and sisters are going
crazy about that.”</p>

<p>“We could have a fresh-air children’s
chorus,” Binks added promptly. “I mean
children brought up to go barefoot and
sleep outdoors in winter and all that sort of
foolishness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“With a special number about women that
get up early and walk barefoot in the dewy
grass,” put in Georgia eagerly.</p>

<p>“And we could have a home-beautiful
monologue.”</p>

<p>“Never mind going any further, Binks,”
Georgia told her firmly. “There is evidently
no lack of material for an extra-special show
entitled Jists and Suffragists.”</p>

<p>“Jists?” repeated Binks blankly.</p>

<p>“Jists—jests, jokes. Didn’t you ever hear
of a merry jist, my peculiar young cousin
from Boston?”</p>

<p>“Well, I have now,” said Binks imperturbably.
“And it will be no merry jist at all
if I’m not on hand at four to go walking with
the Poetess. So I must rush home. You
think the faculty and Miss Wales will be sure
to approve, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’m sure they will, but you’d better
not assign the jist and suffragist parts to
your little friends until you hear from me,”
advised Georgia. “It’s considered good form
not to be too sure in advance of faculty permits.”</p>

<p>When Binks had gone, Georgia lay back on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
her broad window-seat and chuckled. “She’s
all right, is my peculiar cousin,” Georgia reflected.
“Jists and Suffragists will drag her
into Dramatic Club without any help from
me. And she doesn’t know it. She wouldn’t
care if she did know it. And I almost let Clio
Club get her, just because she was in the
family and so I never appreciated her! Well,
I appreciate her now. I guess I’ll go
and find Betty and get her to come with
me to see Miss Ferris about the extra-special
show.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Never in the whole history of Harding College
had there been a more successful affair
than Binks’s altogether impromptu, go-as-you-please
Benefit Performance. Binks’s method
of arranging the various stunts was quite simple.</p>

<p>“Is your mother a club-woman?” she demanded
of each prospective head of a committee.
“Well, is she a fresh-air fiend? Or a
Suffragette? Or does she go in hard for exercise?
She does? Then won’t you please
be Georgia’s right-hand man on her committee?
Georgia is getting up some killing kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
of a dance, to make fun of the exercise business.</p>

<p>“Now, Susanna, you were brought up on
fresh air, and you can write songs. Write
one for a chorus of fresh-air-brought-up children,
won’t you? You can choose your own
chorus to sing the song, and consult with them
about costumes and all that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>It worked like a charm, Binks’s method.</p>

<p>“You see,” Fluffy explained it, “a clever
girl is sure to have a clever mother, and nowadays
all clever mothers have fads. Ours has
the no-breakfast fad. Straight is trying to
write a one-act tragedy entitled, ‘Before Breakfast,
Never After.’ It will be tragic all right if
it goes the way I felt the summer that I obligingly
tried to join the anti-breakfast crusade.”
Fluffy, who was engaged at the moment in
eating a particularly hearty breakfast at the
Tally-ho, returned happily to her second order
of waffles.</p>

<p>Of course the B. C. A.’s heard about the extra-special
show, and Madeline, who was still
in Harding celebrating the acceptance of her
novel, could not resist the lure of a project so
congenial. She wrote Binks a modest little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
note offering to write a one-act farce entitled,
“Waiting Dinner for Mother; or, The Meal-Hour
and the Artistic Temperament.”</p>

<p>“It will be founded on my personal observations,”
Madeline wrote, “and maybe it will
be amusing, because living in Bohemia New
York used to be very amusing indeed, in
spite of too much artistic temperament getting
into the cooking. I think our post-graduate
crowd would act it out for me, and then I
shouldn’t be making you any bother.”</p>

<p>“Bother!” repeated Binks, reading the
note, which she had just picked off the bulletin-board,
aloud to a circle of friends.
“Bother! She’s written a play for Agatha
Dwight—a really-truly play that you sit in
two dollar seats to see. And she hopes it
won’t be a bother if she writes one for this
show!” Binks, who was not yet a recognized
celebrity, nevertheless leaned against the
sacred note-room table, quite overcome by the
splendor of Madeline’s offer.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” she told a crowd of committee
chairmen later, “we’ve got to begin refusing
things. We’ve got all we can make
room for now, and every one is just splendid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“‘Ten Numbers. All Top-Liners and One
Above the Line. A Play by the Celebrated
Miss Ayres. Entertainment Stimulating,
Refreshing, Satisfying. Cuisine the Same.’
How’s that for a scare-head poster?” inquired
Susanna Hart blandly.</p>

<p>“Great!” Georgia told her. “But Madeline’s
play won’t be the only real sensation.
Wait till you see Eugenia Ford in our Rag
Doll Dance. She’s a wonder.”</p>

<p>“Wait till you see the willowy Mariana
Ellison shivering around in the light and airy
costume of a Fresh-Air Child.”</p>

<p>“Wait till you see Fluffy starring as the
Hungriest Daughter in Straight’s tragic drama,
entitled ‘Before Breakfast, Never After.’”</p>

<p>“Wait till you see the whole extra-special
show.” Thus Binks tactfully suppressed too-ardent
rivalries. “Isn’t it just too glorious
for anything the way everybody takes hold?”</p>

<p>“It would be too glorious for anywhere but
Harding College,” Georgia told her eager little
cousin. “You’re getting on to Harding ways
pretty fast these days, Binks Ames.”</p>

<p>Binks smiled absently. “Am I?” she asked.
“I’m having a lovely time, and not studying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
any too much, and Miss Ellison thinks I’m
neglecting her and her poems. But I think the
freshman Jones is worth it. It’s too bad that
she can’t have the fun of the show too; but I
thought it would make her feel queer afterward,
when we tell her about the money’s
being for her, if she’d taken part in her own
show.” Binks smiled again, her sweet, inquiring
smile. “Another queer thing about
Harding is that nobody thinks what a show is
for.”</p>

<p>“If they like it,” added Georgia promptly.
“Remember that, Binks, after you’re out in
the wide, wide world, and you can be a wonderful
help to Aunt Caroline. Aunt Caroline
can supply the Worthy Causes, and you can
match them with Likable Shows.”</p>

<p>“Likable” was a mild word for Binks’s first
effort, whose “Top-Liner” features filled the
big gym. to overflowing all through the afternoon
and evening appointed for it by the
faculty committee. It would easily have filled
the gym. for another afternoon and evening;
nobody who went had time to see everything
properly, and those who were crowded out of
Madeline’s farce or Georgia’s Rag Doll and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Ploshkin Dance fairly wept with rage and disappointment.
But the faculty set their faces
sternly against repetition.</p>

<p>“And I don’t wonder,” said honest little
Binks, “if everybody’s work has slumped the
way mine has.”</p>

<p>But even the faculty enjoyed the show;
possibly they enjoyed it a little more than any
one else. The Suffrage Bazaar occupied the
big stage at the end of the gym. Once in
twenty minutes the bazaar “woke up,” as
the program picturesquely phrased it; and
everybody who was not in one of the small
side-rooms or curtained alcoves enjoying a
side-show, curled up on the floor in a sociable
company to see the Suffragettes militantly
compel the Antis to buy the useful or beautiful
articles they had for sale, such as manacles
for tyrannous males, automatic baby-tenders,
cookless cookers, and other devices likely to
come handy in a home whose head spent her
days in Woman’s-Club-land. The Suffragettes’
persuasive arguments frequently developed
into harangues in behalf of the cause. The
Antis, who were all timid, pretty creatures,
tried to reply, but were speedily heckled down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
by the pointed questions and comments of
their more eloquent opponents. But when a
Mere Man appeared, it was the Antis who got
possession of him, without any argument at
all; and who bore him off to buy violets and
chocolate sundaes, pink pin-cushions, purple
sofa cushions, and all the other bits of useless
frippery that clutter the traditional bazaars
gotten up by old-fashioned women. Just before
the last Suffragist had lapsed into discouraged
silence, a small but determined army
of pretty freshmen in Swiss peasant costume
swarmed out upon the gym. floor with trays
of alluring French cakes and Tally-ho candies,
also alluring. And if you stopped to buy
those, there was a “House Sold Out” sign in
front of Madeline’s play; and if you hurried
to the play, why, you were likely to go to your
grave regretting a certain little cake, with
chocolate-covered sides, a pyramid of marshmallow
on top spread over with jam, and
nobody knew what inside it, that you hadn’t
stopped to buy.</p>

<p>It sent you into hysterics to see Mariana
Ellison, clad in a scant white dress, white
stockings, and black ties, throwing cotton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
snowballs at other tall, scantily attired children,
while they all sang a lusty chorus about
being cold and well and happy to the tune of
“A Hot Time.” But if you waited to see
them do it again, you missed that mirth-provoking
parody on æsthetic dancing, in which
twelve Rag Dolls and twelve Ploshkins
flopped through a bewitching ballet, the
“jist” of which was that the Ploshkins
courted the Rag Dolls ardently until the Rag
Dolls, remembering that they were new
women, turned from pursued to pursuers—and
pricked themselves painfully on the
Ploshkins’ prickly, slippery tails.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Binks when it was all over,
“I guess they all had a good time.”</p>

<p>“Too good for the money,” Georgia told
her, “but that’s a general failing of Harding
shows, so don’t take it to heart. And as for
profits,—I guess the freshman Jones can pass
the rest of her life in a sanitorium if she
wants to.”</p>

<p>“Miss Wales is going to arrange about
that,” explained Binks. “She went to see
her to-night and told her about the plan, and
Miss Jones is delighted—of course, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
Miss Wales put it so nicely. Oh, I almost
forgot! Miss Wales brought me a note from
her freshman—Miss O’Toole. I stuck it into
my shirt-waist.” Binks felt for the note and
tore it open, whereupon five yellow bills fell
out at her feet.</p>

<p>“A hundred dollars! Whew!”</p>

<p>“Fifteen weeks more paid for at that sanitarium!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Montana Marie!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you ask her to take part, Binks?”</p>

<p>“What does she say about the money,
Binks? Hurry up and tell us, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“I can if you’ll give me a chance,” Binks
retorted. “She says that she couldn’t be a
Rag Doll as Georgia asked her to, because it
would have taken her mind from her work.
But she came to-night, and had a ‘swell’
time; and she sends her contribution to the
expenses, and hopes other girls who were too
busy to help as much as they wanted to will
think to do the same. Isn’t she the best
ever?” Binks’s brown eyes shone softly.
“Can’t we print her letter in the ‘Argus’
or stick it up on the bulletin-board or something?
Lots of girls in this college have stray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
hundred dollars or stray five dollars that they
simply don’t think to give to Miss Wales. If
more people would think, more girls could
get loans—even some freshmen—and then
these dreadful things——” Binks paused in
consternation at the narrow escape she had
had from betraying the confidence of the
junior Jones.</p>

<p>“If more people would think straight,”
Georgia came swiftly to her rescue, “why,
fewer people would act crooked. Well, I
know at least one matron who will think
daggers if Fluffy and Straight and I don’t
dash for home. So keep the rest of your theories
for to-morrow, Binks, and come along.”</p>

<p>And they went, singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Here’s to Miss Marie, Drink her down!</div>
<div class="verse2">Here’s to Miss Marie, Drink her down!</div>
<div class="verse2">Here’s to Miss Marie, She is fresh from gay Paree,</div>
<div class="verse2">Drink her down, drink her down, drink her down, down, down!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>in a fashion at once mocking and admiring.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE TALLY-HO’S DIGNIFIED DINNER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Tally-ho Tea-Shop was going to open
a regular catering department. That was
Betty’s “lovely new idea,” which had been
her principal reason for coming back to Harding.
Through the desperately busy first days
of the term it had slumbered; the single-handed
management of Montana Marie
O’Toole had kept it in the background; the
pathetic episode of the Jones sisters had delayed
it still further. But when the B. C.
A.’s stepped forward to share in the tutoring
of Montana Marie, and when Jim Watson appeared
to take Betty off on long, refreshing
rides, and to remind her, by many small
and tactful attentions, that at least one person
in the world was tremendously interested
in all her ideas and plans and achievements,—then
at last did the lovely new idea
for the Tally-ho get its innings. Betty took
a day off from her freshman and her secretaryship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
to think the whole thing over.
Then she called a business meeting of “resident
owners,” which was Madeline’s high-sounding
name for herself and Babbie and
Betty. Then she wrote to Mr. Morton, and
saw to it that Babbie stopped thinking about
Mr. Thayer and “the” wedding long enough
to write to Mrs. Hildreth. And the next
thing, since everybody heartily agreed about
the splendor of the new idea, was to begin.</p>

<p>In this connection Betty enunciated another
of her amusing business theories. “It’s easy
enough to make grand and elegant plans,” she
declared. “But there’s a perfectly awful gap
between planning and doing. And in business
it’s only the doing that counts.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Babbie solemnly. “Of
course we want to wait until we are perfectly
sure what is the very best way of starting
in.”</p>

<p>Betty sighed despairingly. “Oh, Babbie,
that’s just what I didn’t mean! I meant that
the longer we think and consider and wonder
how to begin, the longer,—we don’t begin,”
she ended forlornly.</p>

<p>Madeline patted her shoulder comfortingly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
“I understand, if Babbie, the lady of leisure,
doesn’t. Of course she doesn’t! How can
she, when she never has to make an opportunity,
and then cram herself down its unwilling
throat? Begin any old way, Betty.
Only begin. I know the catering department
will be a big success.”</p>

<p>And so Betty began—with Miss Raymond’s
dinner. Miss Raymond had moved off the
campus, and had a dear little house of her
own, away up on the top of Oak Hill. Fräulein
Wendt lived there with her, and a fat old
French woman kept house for them—exactly
as she pleased. And just as Betty was ready
to open her catering establishment, a famous
author from London came to Harding to
deliver a lecture, and also to see Miss Raymond,
whom he had met years before in
England and wanted to meet again. Miss
Raymond was giving a dinner for him.
Celine’s cooking would do beautifully, she
told Betty, coming to her to ask if Nora or
Bridget knew of a waitress that she could
have in for the great occasion. But Celine’s
waiting and Celine’s table-laying—they would
strike terror to his orderly English soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“I remember the dinners his sister used to
give,” she went on. “Such perfect ones, with
the loveliest flowers and the daintiest menu
cards—you know they use menu cards over
there, or they used to, where we should have
place-cards—and after dinner just one lovely
song or some other fascinating bit of entertainment
to start the good talk going. If only I
weren’t so busy! I simply can’t think of anything
so frivolous as a dinner. Why couldn’t
that provoking man have waited till the
proofs of my new book were finished?”</p>

<p>Betty murmured polite sympathy, and
then, when Miss Raymond had once more
remembered her errand and looked suggestively
at the door that led to Bridget and Nora,
she bravely made the fatal plunge. Miss
Raymond was a dreadful person to begin a
thing on. She was hard to please. She never
made allowances. She never explained what
she wanted; she merely expected you to grasp
her ideas with no help at all from her. But,
as Madeline would have said, Miss Raymond
was Opportunity knocking on the door of the
Tally-ho Catering Department. A beginning
was a beginning. So Betty plunged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>She explained the idea, and then timidly
suggested that the new Catering Company
should attempt to supply Celine’s deficiencies
in the matter of decoration and service. And
Miss Raymond, with a gasp of relief and a
vague, “You know just the sort of charming
thing I want,” fled joyously back to her
neglected proofs, leaving Betty in a very
perturbed, very mixed state of mind. She
had got her longed-for chance to begin, but
experimenting on Miss Raymond and a great
English novelist certainly had its little drawbacks.
Even Madeline was somewhat over-awed
by the great name of the novelist, and
Babbie Hildreth was frankly aghast at Betty’s
daring.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we have started in with a freshman
spread?” she asked. “Then, after a
year or so, we could work up to the grandeur
of Miss Raymond. Aren’t you scared to
death, Betty, for fear things will go wrong?
Imagine how she’d glare at a waitress who
didn’t pass things to suit her! The poor
creature would probably drop her dishes and
flee for her very life.”</p>

<p>“Not Nora,” said Betty stoutly. “I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
going to do the table myself, and I shall stay
on in the kitchen during dinner to make sure
that things are sent in looking right. Emily
Davis will attend to that part later, but for this
first time——”</p>

<p>“You are scared to death,” cried Babbie
triumphantly. “But you needn’t be. It will
be a howling success, that dinner. I feel it
in my bones. And when Miss Raymond is
pleased, she is very, very pleased. It will be
the making of the Tally-ho Catering Department,
Betty Wales, and I shall write Mother
that you are the boldest and most fearless
caterer in the whole country, and that she’d
better engage you for our wedding without
further delay.”</p>

<p>Betty laughed. “What you will really do
without delay, Miss Hildreth, is to advise me
about the flowers for the table, and the place-cards.
Of course, for such a terribly intellectual
party, our usual Tally-ho ideas are all
out of the way.”</p>

<p>Babbie nodded thoughtfully. “Of course.
She wants a perfectly dignified dinner. Keynote:
expensive simplicity. Roses in a tall
glass vase, and place-cards engraved with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
family crest if she has one. Color scheme
depending upon her china. Or has Celine
smashed so much china that we shall have to
use ours? You’ll have to conciliate the
autocratic Celine, Betty; so you’d better be
brushing up your French in your idle moments.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother with French, but take me
on your preliminary scouting trip,” amended
Madeline. “I have yet to discover the fat
foreign cook that I can’t conciliate. I love
them so, that I instantly win their foolish
hearts.”</p>

<p>The scouting trip disclosed the fact that
Celine was good-natured, if set in her ways.
Also, she had not smashed any of the gold
and white Raymond-heirloom china. Instead
she kept it under lock and key, and Miss
Raymond and Fräulein Wendt were compelled
to be satisfied with a plebeian, modern blue
and white set purchased by command of the
thrifty Celine, who had an obsession to the
effect that some day Miss Raymond would
marry and have a real home of her own. For
this happy consummation Celine insisted upon
hoarding the ancestral silver, china, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
mahogany, sternly refusing to waste what she
shrewdly recognized as real treasures upon this
make-believe, makeshift housekeeping, divided
between a drab little German lady and
a distrait and absent-minded professor in petticoats,
whom Celine adored and scolded by
turns.</p>

<p>“And for ze grand partie, it is all as you
wish,” she assured Betty magnificently. “It
will do them gut—dis grand partie. I will
make food for ze god, mam’selle, chust as you
wish. Ze mam’selle, she is busy to-day—no
count to disturb. She say do as ze little
mam’selle wish, and all goes well. Voilà!”</p>

<p>So Babbie bought long-stemmed yellow roses,
and borrowed Mary’s tallest and slenderest
wedding-present vase to put them in. And
when Betty demurred a little at the formidable
price of engraved crests, Madeline painted the
design in red and gold. Then, to amuse herself,
she made another set of Tally-ho-ish cards
with clever, flippant pictorial take-offs of the
guests as decoration, and below leading questions,
“just to start the good talk going,” she
mimicked Miss Raymond gaily.</p>

<p>“I’d like to plan the great Mr. Joram a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
dinner,” she declared, “a real live American-college-girl
dinner, that would make him sit
up and like us all. I say, Betty, wouldn’t Miss
Raymond stand for a little gleam of originality?”</p>

<p>Betty considered, looking troubled. “Of
course those cards are terribly clever, and she
might like them, but—if she didn’t——”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” Babbie took up the tale. “If she
didn’t, the Tally-ho Catering Department
would be done for. Miss Raymond is a woman
of the world, Madeline. She met Mr. Joram
in formal London society, and she wants
to——”</p>

<p>“Do a perfectly good return engagement,”
finished Madeline calmly. “All right, only
she’s wasting the chance of a lifetime. Tell her
so, please, Betty, with my compliments. To
pay for a Tally-ho-ish dinner, and then get yellow
roses and crests and regular food—it doesn’t
strike me as a square deal. But if that’s what
they want, that’s what we furnish. I must design
a Tally-ho Catering Department folder,
explaining that we are all things to all men,
from a dignified dinner without features for
Miss Raymond to a Stocking Factory Twelfth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
Night Masque, all features, for Mr. Thayer. By
the way, Betty, we ought by rights to have begun
on Mr. Thayer.”</p>

<p>“He’s too busy getting ready to be married,”
laughed Betty. “He isn’t interested in factory
parties this year.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, that’s because of me,” explained
Babbie sadly. “But even a philanthropist
has to be absorbingly interested in his new
house and his approaching wedding and his
honeymoon. After that,”—Babbie sighed
joyously,—“after that you’ll have to help us
and the Stocking Factory to live happy ever
after. And we shall give lots of stunty parties,
and we shall need lots of catering, with
features.”</p>

<p>“Catering without features charged extra,”
Madeline read from the folder she was busily
composing, “to compensate the company for
the loss of their customary diversions.”</p>

<p>“Madeline!” sighed Babbie resignedly.
“What perfect foolishness! You know features
are great bothers to think up.”</p>

<p>“Also great fun,” retorted Madeline. “And
I’ll bet you a cookie—a frosted one of Cousin
Kate’s—that even the intellectual Miss Raymond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
would like some features, if she only
stopped to consider the matter.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t be sure that she would,”
Betty explained again patiently. “And so
isn’t it safer to act like any other Catering
Company and stick to the Dignified Dinner
program?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” Madeline agreed promptly.
“Keeping my terribly clever place-cards concealed
about your person, and my latest Palmist
and Crystal-gazer stunt on the other end
of the Tally-ho’s telephone line. But I bet
you a dozen Cousin Kate’s cookies that if she
is given her choice, Miss Raymond will vote
for the features.”</p>

<p>“I probably shan’t see her until after dinner,”
Betty explained. “So she can’t be
given her choice. But I’ll take the clever
place-cards along. And if you can read
palms, Madeline Ayres, begin on mine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please do mine first,” begged Babbie,
“and tell me all about my wedding and after.
Why didn’t you tell us before that you could
read palms?”</p>

<p>“Because I learned only last week,” Madeline
defended herself coolly, and then proceeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
to read all Babbie’s future in the lines
of her soft little hands in a manner that Babbie
and Betty agreed in characterizing as
“just perfectly wonderful.”</p>

<p>The Dignified Dinner was to be at seven.
At six Betty arrived to arrange the yellow
roses, dispose the crested place-cards according
to Miss Raymond’s orders, and make sure
that Celine was doing her part and that Nora
understood what hers was to be.</p>

<p>“My mam’selle is making ze letter in ze libraire,”
Celine told her disconsolately. “She
belong in ze chambre making ze toilette.
Voilà! What is it to be done?”</p>

<p>“The salad—for us,” laughed Betty, and
Celine joined in good-naturedly, only stopping
now and then in the construction of the salad
to reconnoiter in her mam’selle’s quarters and
to lament that “ze toilette” was even yet not
begun.</p>

<p>But at quarter to seven Miss Raymond, “ze
toilette” completed, though rather sketchily,
hurried into the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Wales,” she began, “is everything
ready? Did I tell you about the seating?
Did I tell you that Professor Francis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
isn’t coming? So now I want Mrs. Merwin
opposite Mr. Joram.” She swept back to the
table. “It’s very pretty,” she said, gazing absently
from the roses to the crests. “These
cards are beautifully done. Did I ask you to
plan music or something of the sort for later?
But of course that’s not catering. I’m as nervous
to-night as a freshman before mid-years—and
as stupid. I simply haven’t had one
minute to think since last Sunday. Do I look
fit to be seen, Miss Wales? Oh, thank you.
Hooking the hostess up isn’t catering either,
but you do it so well. I’ll run up and find a
pin to put into that lace in one minute. But
first tell me, are any of my guests musical?
Have they any parlor tricks? Intellectual
dinners are such bores, Miss Wales, unless
they’re made to be distinctive somehow.”</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by the tide of questions,
Betty ran over the guest-list without finding
any one whose “parlor trick” she knew.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” she faltered. “I didn’t know
you wanted me to plan any entertainment. I
thought——”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind,” Miss Raymond cut in
abruptly. “The table is very nice and Celine’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
cooking—it’s all right, Miss Wales, only
I’d dreamed of something—what is it that
you girls say?—stunty. Something that
would be like your tea-shop, and that would
give Mr. Joram a whiff of the informal, amusing
college atmosphere. I ought to have said
so plainly. I never make myself clear.” Miss
Raymond sank into the nearest chair with an
air of complete discouragement.</p>

<p>For one little minute Betty hesitated.
Then she flew to the kitchen and returned
with the terribly clever place-cards, which had
been packed in the basket with Mary’s vase.</p>

<p>“I’ll bring you down a pin,” she volunteered,
“if you’ll tell me where to find one.
Meanwhile look these over and see if you
care to use them. Madeline—Miss Ayres—sent
them on the chance. And if you wanted
a splendid palmist and crystal-gazer for after
dinner, you could have her. The costume is
East Indian, with a mystic veil. We would
have asked sooner, only we thought—we were
afraid——” Betty fled, blushing. There was
no use waiting for directions about the pin, because
Miss Raymond was bestowing her undivided
attention upon the new place-cards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_160">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_160.jpg" alt="SHE PEEPED CAUTIOUSLY IN AT THE DOOR">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">SHE PEEPED CAUTIOUSLY IN AT THE DOOR</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When Betty came back five minutes later
she peeped cautiously in at the door to discover
Miss Raymond happily engaged in rearranging
the table, chuckling softly to herself
as she moved about. Betty, who had found
Fräulein Wendt and a pearl and amethyst
pin, came timidly forward. Miss Raymond
looked up at her with an expression of girlish
gaiety that made you forget that she was ever
cold and distant and hard to please.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” she said, “you’ve made
my dinner! These cards hit them all off to
the life. Nothing else will matter after such
a good start, but bring on your crystal-gazing
palmist. Put her in the little red sitting-room.
Arrange things as you like. And—Mr.
Joram will want to meet Miss Ayres.
Couldn’t you ask her to come up later this
evening?”</p>

<p>Betty started to explain that Miss Raymond
must choose between Madeline and the crystal-gazing
palmist, and then remembered the
point Madeline had made of the mystic veil
that was to keep her interestingly anonymous.</p>

<p>So, “I’m afraid she can’t come to-night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
Miss Raymond,” Betty explained demurely.
“That is, not until very late. I—I think
she’s engaged for to-night.”</p>

<p>“Then I want to engage your catering company
for another dinner next week, when Mr.
Joram comes back. I’ll let you know the night,
and Miss Ayres must come then for dinner.”</p>

<p>Three hours later Betty, tired but triumphant,
was assisting the crystal-gazing palmist
to extract the pins from the entangling meshes
of her mystic veil. The crystal-gazing palmist
was also triumphant. Nobody had pierced
the disguise of the mystic veil. Miss Raymond
had told Mr. Joram all about that queer
amusing Miss Ayres, who stopped writing
plays for Agatha Dwight to design candle
shades for the Tally-ho Tea-Shop. Mr. Joram
had inquired sotto voce of the palmist if
faculty dinners at Harding were always like
this one. Miss Ferris had blushed ignominiously
when the palmist found a wedding
within a year in her hand. Best of all,
George Garrison Hinsdale—Mary fortunately
was spending the week with Babe—had assured
the palmist solemnly that her character
readings were “simply stunning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“It wasn’t a very dignified dinner,” said
Betty, pulling out the last pin, just as a fresh
burst of laughter floated out from the rooms
in front.</p>

<p>Madeline smiled. “Rather not—nor intellectual.
But they’ve had a good time. By
the way, may I collect my cookies as I go home?
I’ve decided to sit up and write for a while,
and I shall need midnight refreshments.”</p>

<p>“Of course you can have them or anything
else we’ve got,” Betty promised gratefully.
“Oh, Madeline, you are a jewel! Just suppose
we hadn’t had any substitutes for crests
and—and—dignity.”</p>

<p>Madeline yawned. “Before I write the
play that I’m going to do to-night,” she announced
casually, “I’ll amend our advertising
circular. I’m going to cross out ‘Catering
without Features charged extra,’ and say
‘Catering without Features may be had elsewhere.’”</p>

<p>“But that will sound fearfully unbusinesslike,”
Betty protested.</p>

<p>“Business,” began Madeline dogmatically,
“is the art of putting your best foot forward.
Our best foot is features. Business is giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
the people what they want. They all want
features, even the touch-me-not Raymonds and
the high and mighty Jorams. Ergo——”
she waved her mystic veil convincingly.
“You began with features, Betty. You’re
therefore committed to features. And I,
crystal-gazing palmist and seeress of renown,
prophesy that the Tally-ho Catering Department
will succeed beyond our wildest dreams,
with features. Now come and help me find
those cookies.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>RESCUING MONTANA MARIE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pre-Christmas</span> excitements and Christmas
gaieties were alike things of the past. Harding
was bleak and snow-bound in the clutches
of a real old-fashioned New England January.
And the college cynics declared gloomily that
the cold and forbidding weather was a symbol
of cold and unforgiving faculty hearts.</p>

<p>“There are too many of us,” sighed Straight,
who was more worried than she cared to
admit over her record in junior argument.
“Prexy thinks this college is getting too big.
Maybe it is, but can’t they wait till next year
to have it get smaller? It’s rather hard on
us, I think, to try to crowd us out, just because
they calmly let in such a huge mob of
freshmen.”</p>

<p>“Well, the whole huge mob wanted to come
and passed its exams all right,” argued Fluffy.
“So how could it be lawfully kept out? But
imagine the freshmen’s states of mind about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
now, poor things, with all these horrid rumors
flying around. Why, if I were a this year’s
freshman I believe I should give up the game
and end my days in a boarding-school.”</p>

<p>“You would!” sniffed Straight. “You’re
a nice one to sympathize with frightened
freshies. You never got warned in your
life!”</p>

<p>“Well, just the same I’ve been scared times
enough,” demurred Fluffy. “Being scared
hasn’t anything to do with a good reason for
being scared, specially not for freshmen.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right,” said Straight reflectively.
“I’ve seen several prods act speechless
with fright, but I always thought it indicated
that they weren’t genuine prods at all,—only
clever bluffers.”</p>

<p>“You mean me for one, I suppose,” said
Fluffy cheerfully. “Now just to show you
that I’m a really-truly prod and no bluffer,
I’ll take you home and tell you about a priori
argument. And then maybe you’ll have a
little more respect for the high quality of my
brains.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie O’Toole shared keenly in
the prevalent mood of depression. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
radiant smile was dimmed; her cheerful interest
in each and every aspect of college life
waned. She concentrated her mind on her
work so violently that she grew pale and thin
under the strain. Betty and the Concentrating
Influence united in protests against the
wanton sacrifice of so much youth and beauty;
but Montana Marie stood firm.</p>

<p>“It’s now or never for little me. I’m bright
enough to see that far in front of me,” she
told them with forced gaiety. “I guess I can
better afford to lose a little sleep and exercise
than I can to risk failing in these awful mid-years.”</p>

<p>A little tremor of fright and nervous dread
shook Miss O’Toole’s fine shoulders, and Betty,
feeling that she had been pushing her protégée
much too hard, took her out for a walk and
a merry dinner at the Tally-ho, at which
kind-hearted Fluffy poohed at mid-year
terrors, Madeline Ayres led Marie on to reminisce
of dear old Paree, Babbie Hildreth won
her heart by asking advice about bridesmaids’
dresses, and the mirth of the company in
general left her utterly forgetful of math.,
Latin prose, and English One, of concentration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
mid-years, and the strenuous life of a
conditioned freshman.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a perfectly grand time,” she told
Betty, as they parted in the corridor at Morton
Hall. “Gracious, but I do love a good time.
I’d like to do nothing but enjoy myself for
one solid week. I shan’t work so hard after
mid-years are over—if I’m not over then too.”
Marie’s laugh at her own joke was rather
spiritless, and her expression grew suddenly
serious. For mid-years would not be over for
another two weeks, and Mrs. Hinsdale’s long
round of visits had resulted disastrously to
progress in Latin prose. Connie could not
help with that, but she was splendid about the
originals in solid geometry.</p>

<p>“If I owned a school,” Marie told her gratefully,
“I’d hire you and Mrs. Hinsdale and
Miss Mason, and I guess Miss Adams, to teach
there. Only of course Miss Adams wouldn’t
leave Harding, and Mrs. Hinsdale couldn’t
leave her husband, and Miss Mason is going to
Germany next year to study. But you’d
come, wouldn’t you? Only of course I don’t
own a school, and I don’t suppose I ever
shall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“I’m just as much obliged for your offer,”
Connie told her brightly. “Now you’d better
go right to bed and get well rested. It’s less
than a week before you’ll have to begin to
cram.”</p>

<p>“What in the world do you mean by
cram?” inquired Marie blankly.</p>

<p>Connie explained, and Marie gave a despairing
sigh. “Blanket your windows, or get a
special permit from the matron, drink coffee,
tie a wet towel around your head, and study
till three <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>,” she repeated aghast. “Well,
I guess I will go right to bed. Just the
thought of this cramming prospect makes me
tired. Is it compulsory?”</p>

<p>Connie explained the official disapproval of
cramming, and then quoted the famous rhyme
about the luckless wight who</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent">“did not hurry</div>
<div class="verse2">Nor sit up late to cram.</div>
<div class="verse2">She did not even worry</div>
<div class="verse2">But—she failed in her exam.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“I see,” said Montana Marie briefly. The
next morning she went down-town and bought
a copper coffee-maker. It matched her chafing-dish,
added greatly to the elegance of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
tea-table, and was the envy of every Morton
Hallite. Montana Marie listened politely to
the popular chorus of admiration, and said
nothing about the real reasons which had
actuated her extravagant purchase.</p>

<p>Betty Wales knew nothing about the
coffee-maker, or Connie’s ideas on cramming;
but she was quite as worried about her protégée’s
prospects as Montana Marie could possibly
be herself.</p>

<p>“The poor thing is perfectly sure she’s
going to flunk,” she told the B. C. A.’s at a
special tea-drinking called by Mary to discuss
the impending crisis.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, so is every freshman sure she’ll
flunk,” condoled Babbie Hildreth easily, “and
most sophomores.”</p>

<p>Betty nodded. “Of course. The difference
is that the rest won’t flunk, except a few
who aren’t expecting to, and Marie will, I
guess, from all that I hear.”</p>

<p>The acting tutors exchanged surreptitious
glances, and reluctantly agreed that Betty
was right.</p>

<p>“Has she really lost her nerve—given up
the ship?” asked Madeline thoughtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“Oh, no,” Betty told her, “she’s trying
harder than ever. She’s determined to pass.”</p>

<p>“She’s working too hard, probably,” said
Mary thoughtfully. “She really knows a
good average amount about Latin prose.”</p>

<p>“Her themes are fair now,” put in Madeline.</p>

<p>“She knows heaps more about freshman
lit. than I ever did,” acknowledged Helen
Adams.</p>

<p>“When she isn’t nervous about it she can
reason out her geometry pretty well,” Christy
testified. “She’s naturally quite logical.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Babbie Hildreth, looking
sternly at the official tutors, “if you’ve done
your duty, as you imply that you have, and
she’s fairly well up in everything, why in the
world are you so pessimistic about her exams?”</p>

<p>Mary answered for them all. “She is all
right enough when she’s only reciting to us,
or even in regular class work. But she realizes
that the faculty are going to be extra-fussy
with her, because of her conditions
and the general situation. She never passed
a formal exam in her life till she came here
last year——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“And then she flunked more than she
passed,” put in Madeline flippantly.</p>

<p>“She thinks, like all little freshmen, that
everything depends on mid-years, and she’ll
get nervous and excited, and write utter nonsense,”
ended Mary, disregarding the interruption.</p>

<p>“Give her soothing syrup,” suggested Madeline,
who refused to take Montana Marie’s
troubles seriously. Babbie frowned at her,
and then, leaning forward on one elbow, she
frowned at space, thinking very hard indeed
about the far-away days when she was the
prettiest, the idlest, the most reckless, and
the cleverest of the famous “B” trio, and had
mid-years of her own and Bob’s and Babe’s to
worry about, and plan to scrape through
somehow, for the honor of the B’s and the
“finest class” of 19—. Everybody else was
thinking, too, but Babbie was the first to have
an articulate idea.</p>

<p>“Why, Babe used to be just that way,” she
said in a surprised tone. “If she crammed a
lot and got to thinking how terrible mid-years
are, why, she couldn’t do anything. And
Bob was just the opposite—never paid attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
in class, just dawdled along, and then
sat up all night with the text-book for the
course and some prod’s note-book that she’d
borrowed, and next day she could answer
anything. After mid-years the faculty always
thought they’d misjudged Bob.” Babbie giggled
cheerfully. “Babe really knew heaps
more. We used to have such times persuading
her to frivol all mid-year week.”</p>

<p>“How’d you do it?” asked Madeline idly.</p>

<p>“Pretended to frivol ourselves. Did frivol
some to get her started. Got up anti-cram
movements. Insinuated that we weren’t going
to sit up a single night that year. Oh, it
was an awful bother getting Bob a chance to
grind and keeping Babe from grinding and
tending up to things a little myself,” ended
Babbie with a reminiscent sigh.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s lucky you had such a lot of
practice,” Mary Brooks Hinsdale told her
sweetly, “and that you came back here this
week to see about the big fireplace for the
Robert Thayers’ library. Because you are
qualified to act, and are hereby elected to act,
as chairman of the committee on the mid-year
madness of Montana Marie O’Toole. Betty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
the assistant tutors, and everybody else who is
needed to divert her mind, are hereby elected
to the committee. We’ll get that child
through yet, Betty Wales; so please don’t look
so discouraged.”</p>

<p>Betty laughed. “I was only thinking
what a stupid I am, not to have planned all
this long ago myself. Of course you’ll get
her through! Why, I believe you could get
a broomstick doll through mid-years.”</p>

<p>“We are a clever lot,” agreed Madeline
complacently. “Well, I must go. Plan the
campaign, Babbie, assign parts, and we’ll
come in strong at the finish. And the finish
shall not involve the finish of Montana Marie.
Nay, it must not,” she went on in melodramatic
tones. “Montana Marie is a treasure.
To bury her in her native state or to return
her to dear distant Paree would be to deprive
the Harding firmament of its brightest star—and
me of my most treasured understudy for
a heroine.”</p>

<p>“There she goes again on her Literary
Career,” cut in Mary scornfully. “Come
home with me for dinner, Babbie, and make
plans for the great campaign. I almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
promised George to go and call on his new
assistant this evening, but I, for one, am
capable of unselfish renunciation. And the
moral of that,”—Mary fastened her furs and
linked arms with the submissive Babbie,—“is:
when the new assistant is a frump, George
really shouldn’t ask me to call on her. Good-bye,
Betty. If you think best, you might
relieve Prexy’s mind about his over-conditioned
freshman. Not knowing us as well as
you do, he may be getting quite desperate.”</p>

<p>The thought of mid-year week had been
a nightmare to Montana Marie. Studying
every minute, sitting up half the night, worrying,
hurrying, spending your time on the
questions you weren’t asked and forgetting
the answers to the ones you were—that, in
brief, had been her notion of the fatal occasion.
But a few days before the ordeal she
began to get some new ideas. Betty called
her into her cozy room at the Morton to say
encouraging things about the effort she was
making and to advise her not to overwork.
Pretty Babbie Hildreth came to call, said
more flattering things about Marie’s valuable
opinions of bridesmaids’ dresses, and hoped,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
very casually, that she wasn’t planning to
cram; it was just a silly freshman trick, and
always did more harm than good. Madeline
Ayres dragged Marie off to a matinée at the
Junction. Helen Adams took her for a walk
at the hour appointed for an English lesson.</p>

<p>“And we talked all the way about men,”
Marie told Connie afterward. “Imagine
Miss Adams getting on to that subject! She
knows quite a lot about it, too. I suppose she
takes her ideas out of Shakespeare and Thackeray
and Scott and the rest of the classics.
I’ve found some of them right here in ‘Much
Ado about Nothing.’ I never thought of
finding useful ideas in Shakespeare on a real
practical subject like men.”</p>

<p>When mid-year week was actually upon her,
Montana Marie had no time to grow nervous,
or frightened or discouraged, or to overwork.
The B. C. A.’s left her mornings and early
afternoons undisturbed, save for friendly offers
of help from the tutors. But about four
there was always some fun afoot. A walk, a
skating or snow-shoeing party, a sleigh-ride in
Mary’s trim cutter,—then a merry dinner at
the Tally-ho or the Belden, and after that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
were much too sleepy to sit up and study. So
Connie and the new coffee-maker retired
behind a screen, and Montana Marie slept the
dreamless sleep of those who have had their
fill of fresh air.</p>

<p>The first examination she pronounced
“pretty fierce.” The next “wasn’t bad.”
English, she declared, she really enjoyed.</p>

<p>“And what do you think,” she told Connie
in great excitement, “I got in Shakespeare’s
ideas about men. I chose it for my
theme subject. I may not know much about
Shakespeare, but I know a lot about men. I
shouldn’t be surprised if that theme made a
hit.”</p>

<p>It did. The freshman English teacher
showed it to Miss Raymond, and Miss Raymond
read it to a senior theme-class as an
example of the value of having something to
say before you tried to say it.</p>

<p>And so Montana Marie O’Toole passed
through the ordeal of mid-years unscathed
save for a low-grade or two.</p>

<p>“And what is a low-grade or two?” inquired
Babbie scornfully. “Even prods get
those.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“I’ve learned a lot this last week,” Montana
Marie informed Betty gratefully. “I’ve
learned to do an outer edge on the ice, and to
skee—if it isn’t too much of a hill. And I’ve
learned what it means to really concentrate
your mind. I thought before that it meant
to work all the time, just as hard as you can.
But it doesn’t. It means to work like anything
till you’re tired, and then play like
anything till you’re rested. Now that’s my
style. Me for concentration. Concentration
for mine,” ended Montana Marie, whose smile
had recently got back all its former brilliant
radiance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> mid-years safely behind her, Montana
Marie fairly radiated happiness.</p>

<p>“I’m anchored here till June all right, I
guess,” she giggled joyously. “If I don’t do
something extra-specially silly, I guess I can
certainly stay till June. And now that I’ve
caught on to the rights of this concentration
business, why, I can enjoy myself a little. No,
I’m not worrying about next near. I never
worry about things so far off as next year.
Besides, maybe by next year——” Montana
Marie shrugged her shoulders with truly
Parisian éclat, and blithely refused to finish
her sentence.</p>

<p>Montana Marie’s idea of a good time seemed
to center around things to eat. She became
a Perfect Patron of the Tally-ho, and almost
every evening she gave a chafing-dish party
in her room. Connie could not afford to
waste her evenings over chafing-dish parties,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
but she was too obliging to complain. So she
merely disappeared, just before the parties
were due to arrive, spent her evenings studying
with the Thorn or reading in the college
library, and was unaffectedly delighted when,
just as the fudge was cool enough to eat, or
the rarebit done to a turn, Montana Marie left
her guests to search Morton Hall from top to
bottom for her missing roommate.</p>

<p>“The eats are served,” she would announce
with a giggle, when she had discovered
Connie’s whereabouts. “We’re only waiting
for you, so hurry along, and bring all your
friends.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie could never learn the names
of the Morton Hall girls. “They all look
alike to me,” she declared, and hospitably
invited any and all that she met in the corridors
to come and have “eats,” and meet the
Duttons and Georgia and Susanna Hart and
Timmy Wentworth. Marie was past-mistress
of the difficult art of “mixing crowds.”
After her advent Morton Hall suddenly took
its place as a social center among the other
campus houses. The Belden invited the
Morton to be its partner in getting up a house-play.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
It was discovered that two of the
sophomore basket-ball team lived in the
Morton, and one “Argus” editor. The
monthly house spreads, which Betty had
started in the interests of general sociability,
suddenly blossomed out into popular campus
functions. The Morton Hallites were learning
to play as well as they worked, and it was
Montana Marie O’Toole who had taught them.
Betty Wales smiled as she remembered how
hard she had tried to keep Marie out of the
house.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s generally the best plan to let
things sort of decide themselves,” she reflected.
“Then if they go wrong, you can blame it on
the things, and with me, anyway, they usually
go right—only there are some things that just
won’t decide themselves.” Betty Wales was
not thinking of the Tally-ho Catering Department
(which was deciding to be the howling
success that Babbie had predicted), nor of the
Student’s Aid Secretaryship, nor of Montana
Marie O’Toole, among whose faults was
certainly not to be ranked a lack of decision.</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness me!” said Betty Wales at
last to the open fire in her cheerful sitting-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
at Morton Hall. “A girl ought to
know her own mind. I’m old enough to
know what I want. I’m grown up. But I
don’t feel a bit grown up. I just hate flirts.
It’s perfectly dreadful to keep a nice man on
the string. But he won’t let me say no—and
I’m not ready to say yes—not to anybody—yet.”</p>

<p>The little Student’s Aid Secretary put on an
old skirt, a white sweater, and a fuzzy white
cap, and went off for a solitary tramp in the
snow.</p>

<p>“Anyhow it’s better to wait till you’re
quite sure what you want than to decide
wrong and be very unhappy about it afterward,”
she thought, as, looking very young
and irresponsible and contented once more,
she shook the snow out of her hair and hurried
in to her place at the head of a Morton Hall
dinner table.</p>

<p>Montana Marie O’Toole was not at dinner
that evening. After having been for two days
without ready money she had received a
check in the afternoon mail and had promptly
sallied forth to find friends who would help
her spend it. But for some unknown reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
the afternoon seemed to be a busy one for
all the college but Montana Marie. Fluffy
was writing a long over-due lit. paper;
Straight was coaching the sophomore basket-ball
team; Georgia had disappeared directly
after lunch, nobody knew where; Eugenia
Ford was just starting for chemistry lab.;
Timmy Wentworth had promised to go skating.
Finally Montana Marie gave up in
despair and wended her solitary way toward
her bank. She would get the check cashed,
anyway, if she couldn’t find anybody to come
and play with her. She would send a lot of
flowers and candy to all her tutors, and buy a
lovely present for Miss Wales. She hadn’t
half thanked them all for getting her through
mid-years. She had been too busy tearing
around having a good time. It was lucky
that she had happened to walk down-town
alone, because it gave her a chance to think,
and to remember about all the people she
ought to be grateful to. Montana Marie
arrived at the shopping district of Harding in
a fine glow of remorse and appreciation. She
was just turning the corner to the bank when
she met Dorothy Wales, walking sedately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
along in company with another little girl—a
fat little girl with twinkling blue eyes and the
general flyaway air of having dressed in a
hurry.</p>

<p>Dorothy greeted Miss O’Toole with shy
politeness, and Montana Marie smiled her
most expansive smile in return.</p>

<p>“Come in with me while I get some
money,” she urged hospitably, “and then we
can go down street together.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we can’t,” began Dorothy, but
the fat little girl overruled her.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on,” she urged. “We can run
all the way home up that back street.”</p>

<p>In the bank, while she waited her turn at
the cashier’s window, Montana Marie had a
thought. “What do you kids want most in
the world?” she demanded genially, as they
went out.</p>

<p>The fat child had her heart’s desire on her
tongue’s end. “Cream puffs—all I can eat.”</p>

<p>Dorothy laughed up into Montana Marie’s
lovely, smiling face. “How silly, Janet
Peyton, to want cream puffs the most of anything,”
she said reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want most of anything,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
dearie?” insisted Marie. Her great thought
had been to the effect that the nicest thing she
could do for Miss Wales was to make the
Smallest Sister blissfully happy. Incidentally
it would be fun to fill up fat little Janet Peyton
with cream puffs.</p>

<p>Dorothy considered carefully, bound not to
rush into silliness.</p>

<p>“If you’d asked me yesterday,” she explained
at last, “I’d have said a turquoise
ring right away, ’cause turquoises are my
birth-stone, and all my roommates have got
rings with their birth-stones in. But to-day
I think I’d rather have a pink sash and pink
hair-bows, to freshen up my old white dress
for the school party that we’re going to have
this week. Betty says I don’t need a new
dress, so I s’pose I don’t. But whatever she
says, my sash is awfully mussy.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie steered her charges into the
nearest jewelry store and demanded turquoise
rings. Fat little Janet opened her blue eyes
in astonishment, and Dorothy blushed very
red and picked at Marie’s sleeve.</p>

<p>“I can’t have one,” she explained in an
agitated whisper. “I only said I wanted one.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
Oh, no, you mustn’t get it for me. Betty
wouldn’t like me to take such a elegant present
from you.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie patted her shoulder soothingly.
“Yes, she would—just a little ring—from
me. Your sister is so lovely to me, and
there’s so little I can do in return. We’ll take
the littlest ring if you like—there’s nothing
very elegant about that. Now come along
and find the pink ribbons and the cream
puffs.”</p>

<p>At the big dry-goods store Dorothy again
timidly explained that Betty wouldn’t want
her to take such big presents from any one, and
Montana Marie kissed her troubled little face,
bought the widest, softest pink sash in the
shop, with extra-long hair ribbons to match,
pressed the tempting parcel into her hands,
and tucked the tiny ring box deep down in
her coat pocket.</p>

<p>“Now for cream puffs,” she said, smiling at
fat little Janet.</p>

<p>“We’re awfully late already, Janet,” began
Dorothy. “Do you think——”</p>

<p>“Come, don’t be selfish,” Marie broke in
gaily. “You’ve had your presents, and now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
it’s Janet’s turn. You can run home up that
back way, you know.”</p>

<p>Cuyler’s was nearer than the Tally-ho, so
they went there. Marie ordered hot chocolate
to go with the cream puffs, and ices to cool
off on, because they had hurried so, and a
German pancake because she had never tried
one and wanted to see what it was like. And
whenever fat little Janet finished an order of
cream puffs, Marie instructed the waitress to
bring more. She made the eating of all the
cream puffs you wanted seem the most delightful
and reasonable thing in the world.
Finally fat little Janet smacked her lips over
a luscious crusty mouthful, pushed back her
plate with a sigh, and said she was through.</p>

<p>“How I’m ever going to run up that hill!”
she ruminated sadly. “I’ve eaten too much,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“You’ve just got to run,” Dorothy told
her firmly, and then she give a little squeal
of dismay. “We’ve forgotten Miss Dick’s
errand that we came down-town for. We’ve
got to go back by Main Street after all.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” Montana Marie consoled
them, “because now we can go together. I’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
take you all the way back to Miss Dick’s and
explain about my having made you late, only
I’ve just remembered that I have to be tutored
in English at half-past four, and it’s nearly
that now. But you just tell her, Dorothy,
that I made you come along with me, and
that I’m a friend of your sister’s, and she
won’t scold.”</p>

<p>Miss Dick’s errand was at a drug store; one
of the girls had a bad cold and the school
doctor had prescribed for it.</p>

<p>“Want a soda while we wait?” Marie
asked Janet.</p>

<p>Janet shook her blond head hard. “No,
thank you. It might make us later,” she
said very solemnly.</p>

<p>“How do you two happen to be down-town
without a teacher?” asked Marie curiously.
“In the boarding-schools I went to we always
walked two and two, with a teacher policing
the end of the line.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see Harding is such a safe little
place,” explained Dorothy, “and Miss Dick
believes in trusting us a good deal, and——”</p>

<p>“We’re both honor girls,” cut in Janet
placidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>Montana Marie could not repress a wild peal
of laughter.</p>

<p>“You won’t be any longer, I guess,” she
told them gaily, “but never you mind that.
You’ve had what you wanted most in this
world, and that ought to count for something.”</p>

<p>Pursuing her policy of showing proper
gratitude to those who had helped her to stay
in Harding, Marie asked Helen Adams to
have dinner with her at the Tally-ho.</p>

<p>Over the desert she told the story of her
afternoon adventure. “I wish I knew whether
the fat little one is sick from overeating,” she
said, “and whether Dorothy minded the
scolding she probably got. I ought to have
thought about the consequences, but I never
do for myself, and so I didn’t for them.
Getting in and out of scrapes is the whole fun
of boarding-school, as far as I can see, but
those infants said they were honor girls, so I
guess they haven’t had as much experience
with scrapes as I have. Will Miss Wales be
awfully cross at me, do you think, for getting
her little sister into a mess?”</p>

<p>Uncertainty on this point kept Marie from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
asking questions for two days. Then she
confided her anxieties to Betty, and persuaded
her to go and help find out what had happened
when the “honor girls” came home from
their belated expedition after medicine.</p>

<p>Dorothy came dancing down-stairs to receive
them, flying into Betty’s arms, and
wiggling hastily out to offer a polite hand-shake
to Marie, who grinned sheepishly, and
inquired for Janet.</p>

<p>“She’s all right now,” Dorothy told her,
“but she felt pretty sick that night, and she
says she doesn’t want any more cream puffs at
present and maybe not ever.”</p>

<p>“And did you get scolded for being late?”
asked Marie hastily.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, we did,” explained Dorothy.
“But it wasn’t your fault a bit, Miss O’Toole.
We ought to have said no and stuck to it.
Miss Dick said we ought.”</p>

<p>“And did she take you off the honor list?”
demanded Marie.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, she did,” admitted the Smallest
Sister reluctantly. “For the present she did.
She said she felt that she must, as an example,
but that she really thought we could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
be trusted pretty soon again. You see,” the
Smallest Sister’s face was very earnest, “you
don’t very often meet somebody who will give
you the things you want the most of all in the
world. We explained all that to Miss Dick,
and she said it was an unusual ’sperience to
have happen. And Betty dear, ought I to keep
the sash and the ribbons and the ring? Miss
Dick said I was to ask you about that. Only
I—I didn’t tell her about the ring because—because
I couldn’t stand it to have her say I
mightn’t keep it,” sighed the Smallest Sister
despairingly. “And it’s been just awful
waiting for you to come, because Miss Dick
said it would be best for me to wait till you
came, and not on any account to send for
you.”</p>

<p>“But wasn’t the school party last night?”
asked Marie.</p>

<p>The Smallest Sister nodded. “I wore my
mussy old sash to that.”</p>

<p>“So you didn’t get quite what you wanted
after all,” said Marie when Betty had decided
that Dorothy might keep Marie’s presents,
only Marie mustn’t do so any more. “You
wanted a sash to wear to the party, and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
only got one you couldn’t wear, and I’m awfully
sorry about getting you into a scrape
with Miss Dick. I was so busy feeling grateful
that day that I never thought about anything
else.”</p>

<p>The Smallest Sister sighed. “It’s very
hard to think of everything at once, isn’t it?”
she said quaintly. “Yourself and the person
that’s with you and the person that’s waiting.
’Specially the person that’s waiting.”</p>

<p>“Very ’specially the person that’s waiting,”
repeated Montana Marie O’Toole, with a burst
of merriment quite unwarranted by the
Smallest Sister’s argument.</p>

<p>Betty Wales blushed a vivid scarlet and
looked suspiciously at the mirthful Marie.
But Marie was quite unconscious of Betty’s
indignant scrutiny. Marie was looking blissfully
at nothing in particular, and the
Smallest Sister was looking in amazement at
Marie. Betty Wales’s blush had therefore
been quite unnecessary, and as soon as she
was assured of that it faded as swiftly as it
had come.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>THE POPPING MASCOTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> every well-conducted freshman Montana
Marie O’Toole took a vast interest in
the basket-ball championship. Having been
effectually barred from the team by her
numerous entrance conditions and her even
more numerous fall-term warnings, she was
not disappointed, like some of her friends,
when the team was chosen. Being an insuperable
optimist, she cared not that the
sophomore players were known as the Invincibles
because they had never lost an interclass match.</p>

<p>When a practical-minded freshman player
remarked, “Of course we can’t win, but we
can play ball,” Montana Marie smiled her
dazzling smile and retorted, “Don’t you give
up yet. You can play ball and the rest of us
can shriek—yelling is forbidden, they say, in
this polite institution. And maybe—well,
truth is stranger than fiction,” Montana Marie
concluded with a cheerful giggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>From this and many similar speeches the
team gradually got the impression that Miss
O’Toole had learned some wonderful trick-play
in dear old Paree, which she was saving,
to make sure that the sophomores didn’t get
hold of it, until the very last days of team-practice.
There was still another rumor to
the effect that Montana Marie was as wonderful
at basket-ball as at horseback riding, and
that the faculty, out of deference to her
peculiar position in college, had consented to
her joining the team just before the great
game, provided that her work until then was
kept strictly up to the mark. But when the
Invincibles lost two of their starriest stars, all
because of mere low-grades in some obscure
subject like elocution, the rumor that the
scholarship rule was to be stretched for Marie’s
benefit lost credence. But that she was to be
depended upon to do something, certainly
interesting and probably effective, nobody
seemed to doubt. As Fluffy Dutton remarked,
“She’s an awful bluffer, but somehow she
always comes out on top.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she does,” agreed Straight, who, as
head coach of the sophomore Invincibles, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
peculiarly interested in Montana Marie’s proceedings,
“and the reason is that nobody can
get a word out of her edgewise. Maybe she
has thought up a grand plan, and maybe she
hasn’t an idea in her pretty head. But whichever
way it is, she just smiles the same old
smile. She’s a regular wizard at keeping
secrets, that girl is.”</p>

<p>“Then maybe the freshman coaches are
just as near crazy as you are,” Fluffy threw
out gaily.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet they are,” Straight took up her
twin soberly. “I’ll bet she has even the
freshman captain guessing. I’ll bet the freshman
high moguls would go for her good and
hard, if they dared,—for raising false hopes
and getting the team overexcited, and all that
sort of thing. But they don’t dare, because
they can’t make her out. And there’s one
chance in a hundred that she’s thought up
the grand plan that will save them.”</p>

<p>Straight was a clever forecaster; the situation
in the freshman class was exactly as she
had analyzed it. The team lost its temper
and wasted its practice hours discussing the
truth about Montana Marie. The ruling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
spirits of the freshman class, who saw the fine
esprit de corps of the Invincibles falling in
ruins, raged in executive sessions and singly
and in groups interrogated the sphinx-like
Miss O’Toole. She received their inquiries
with smiles, giggles, and blank, non-committal
impenetrability.</p>

<p>“I should say we ought to win! Well,
rather! Can I do anything to help? Why,
really I can’t tell you offhand like this. I’ll
think hard, and maybe I’ll have a thought—isn’t
that what that killing Fluffy Dutton is
forever saying? And when I have a thought,
I’ll let you know.”</p>

<p>Thus did Montana Marie O’Toole meet the
pointed inquiries of the leading freshmen,
and bring their plans for sounding her to
naught. Montana Marie O’Toole had entered
Harding against all rules and precedents.
She had stayed despite the gloomiest prophecies
to the contrary. With all her peculiarities
she was close friends with the most prominent
upper-class girls. She always got what
she wanted. She wanted the freshman team
to win. “Ergo——” Timmy Wentworth
completed the syllogism with a wave of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
good right arm. Timmy, who was coaching
the freshmen, was unable to decide whether
or not the vague confidence they felt in Marie
offset the damaging effect of their constant
quarrels about her. But being a lover of the
picturesque and the bizarre, Timmy was
personally amused by the episode. Also logic
is logic.</p>

<p>The winter term wore on its long and
tedious course. The weather continued unreasonably
cold; so did the hearts of the
faculty. The Invincibles lost a third member,
their prize home, and the freshmen their best
center. However, a sub who had been taken
on at the last minute turned out to be quite a
wonder at jumping, and on the whole the
freshman chances were looking up a little.
Finally it was only two weeks to the great
game, then ten days, a week, and less than a
week. Timmy Wentworth, being consulted
by the leading freshmen, advised them to go
to Marie once more.</p>

<p>“And this time don’t you be so afraid of
her,” she urged. “Call her bluff. Make her
show her hand. If she gets mad about it,
never you mind. Trick-plays that she keeps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
to herself won’t help us any. Now is the
time for her to come out with her great
thought. If she won’t—or can’t—why, we
shall just have to scrape along without it.”</p>

<p>So a solemn deputation of six, headed by
the class president, waited upon Marie that
same afternoon. Marie listened to them with
her habitual contemplative smile.</p>

<p>“It is getting pretty near the time, if we’re
going to spring something good,” she agreed
vaguely at last. “But say, what makes you
all so sure that I can think of the right
thing?”</p>

<p>The freshman president referred briefly to
the rumors. “Reports like that usually have
some truth in them. Besides, you’ve sort of
hinted at something when we’ve asked you
before.”</p>

<p>“I have? I’ve hinted? Well, that’s news
to me,” declared Marie jovially. “I just said
that I’d try to think, didn’t I, or some pretty
speech like that? Well, I—I’ve been fearfully
busy. But of course, if you’re depending
on me——” Marie paused to giggle riotously.
“I never saw a basket-ball game, you
know,—a big one, that is, with lots of people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
watching and all that. Couldn’t we—couldn’t
we—rattle the other side?”</p>

<p>“How?” demanded the freshman president
inexorably.</p>

<p>Marie indulged in her very Frenchiest
shrug. “Why, the regular ways, I suppose,
only more so.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy to say,” the freshman president
objected sternly. “But the Invincibles
won’t rattle in any regular way. They’re too
sure of themselves.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Montana Marie calmly,
“it’s certainly up to us to think of some
unusual ways.” She settled herself more
comfortably in Connie’s easy chair, and passed
the inexorable freshman president a box of
very expensive chocolates. “Now you folks
go ahead and tell me about what happens at a
big game. Go into all the details. Then
maybe I shall have a thought on the subject
of rattling those Invincibles. Fire away now.
And keep the chocolates moving.”</p>

<p>The president began, rather scornfully.
Never having seen a big game herself, she
soon found herself somewhat hazy about
details. So were the rest of the deputation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
In the end Marie hunted up Connie, who had
retired to a quieter spot for the purposes of
study; and Connie, who, from much experience,
believed in all Montana Marie’s strange
methods, took up the tale. The team-mascots
interested Marie extremely.</p>

<p>“Have we got one fixed up yet?” she demanded.</p>

<p>The deputation explained that they had.
It was to be Professor Hart’s youngest son,
arrayed in “invincible” armor.</p>

<p>Marie nodded approvingly. “What’s
theirs?”</p>

<p>“We think they’ve got black Mandy’s little
Mandy to be it,” explained the freshman president.
“We don’t know how she’s going to
be dressed.”</p>

<p>Marie ruminated. “Does a team ever have
more than one mascot?” she demanded at
last.</p>

<p>Connie said no. “It would be like carrying
a purse full of lucky pennies,” she explained
primly. “One mascot is enough.”</p>

<p>Marie considered. “If there’s no rule
against more than one,” she announced at
last, “I think a whole row stuck up in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
freshman gallery—popping out one at a time,
you know, when things were going against us—would
be sort of rattling—if you ask me.”</p>

<p>“Where’d you keep them till they popped?”
inquired a practical freshman.</p>

<p>Marie shrugged. “Ask Connie.”</p>

<p>“In the boxes that the back row of girls
stand on, couldn’t you?” suggested Connie
promptly.</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed the freshman president.</p>

<p>“Well, what could we have for the extra
ones?” pursued the practical freshman.</p>

<p>“Class animal,” suggested somebody.</p>

<p>“Black Mandy’s Jimmie,” suggested somebody
else. “Little Mandy will curl up and
cry when she sees all the people staring at
her, but Jimmie would be game for anything.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t against any rules, is it, for mascots
to keep popping out?” asked a cautious girl—she
had made herself a leading spirit by
saving her class from many of the indiscretions
common to impulsive freshman bodies.</p>

<p>Connie, upon being appealed to, could not
think of any rule covering the popping out of
extra mascots after the great game had begun.
“Of course,” she said, “Miss Andrews always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
asks the galleries to sit still and not scream;
and near the baskets you can’t have your feet
over the edge. Those are the only rules I
ever heard of.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can get around those all right,”
the freshman president declared easily. “The
mascots can pop as silently as ghosts. But if
the sophs don’t giggle or shriek or make some
silly disturbance just as the Invincible home
is trying to make a basket, or the center is
diving after a new ball—why, then we shan’t
have the bother of carrying you around the
gym. on our shoulders, Miss Marie O’Toole.”</p>

<p>“The bother of what?” demanded Marie
blandly.</p>

<p>The freshman president explained, and
Marie thanked her effusively for her trouble.
“It’s terrible not knowing any of these
American college customs,” she sighed. “But
I’m learning pretty fast. I won’t eat very
much between now and the game, so in case
you do have to carry me——”</p>

<p>“Before we plan on that,” put in the practical
freshman, “we’d better go and get the
mascots engaged and their clothes fixed up.
It’s going to be some work, I can tell you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>Whereat the deputation departed hastily in
search of black Mandy and little Jim, of
purple streamers, metal dish-cloths to serve
as chain armor for the champion mascot, and
canton flannel for the manufacture of a whole
family of white rabbits—the white rabbit
being the freshman class animal.</p>

<p>After that, rumors grew wilder and flew
faster than ever, but none of them could be
verified. The deputation, being composed of
the most canny members of a large and brilliant
class, shrouded all its proceedings in the
deepest mystery; and Montana Marie’s ideas
about the scheme she was supposed to have
devised were much too vague for expression.
Having been ridiculed for her ignorance of
college customs early in the fall term, Marie
had speedily discovered that silence kept one
from being laughed at. That it also gave one
a reputation for diplomacy, for expert bluffing,
and for wonderful eleventh hour inspirations,
was a matter of small concern to Montana
Marie, who had none of Straight Dutton’s
analytical interest in the queer crooks and
turns of human nature.</p>

<p>The day of the great game found Harding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
in a state of unparalleled excitement. There
was the regular great-game-excitement and
the special mystery-excitement. Could the
freshmen possibly win? And how would
they try to do it? The line in front of the
gym. doors was of record length. Even
Mariana Ellison, blasé C. P., who had never
before let a mere game interfere with the unfolding
of her literary emotions, was to be
found in the ranks. Montana Marie was an
usher. In a ravishing white gown, with a
huge purple bow on her lovely hair and a
purple wand in her hand, she helped to direct
the surging freshman mob to its proper place
in the purple-draped balcony. Arrangements
in the freshman gallery seemed to be complicated.
Ushers ran wildly to and fro. The
song leader moved her box three times in
response to their whispered instructions.
Everybody else moved countless times.
Choice seats were abandoned cheerfully for
no obvious reason. An overdose of purple
drapery obstructed the view at the center of
the gallery, but nobody touched a single fold
of the offending decoration.</p>

<p>“The quiet, well-mannered little dears!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
jeered Fluffy Dutton from the riotous sophomore
gallery. “I wonder if they’ll wake up
and take notice when their famous trick-play
comes on the scene—and doesn’t work!”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_204">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_204.jpg" alt="HE WAVED HIS PURPLE BANNER">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">HE WAVED HIS PURPLE BANNER</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But first the teams came on the scene, the
Invincibles dancing gaily around little black
Mandy, who was resplendent in a trailing red
academic gown, with a small red mortar board
topping her fuzzy black braids. Little Mandy
looked frightened and sucked her thumb,
whereas Johnny Hawkins, in metal-dish-cloth
and silver-paper armor, marched proudly at
the head of the freshman players, and he
waved his purple banner with its white rabbit
emblem in a bold and fearless manner that
quite upset the decorum of the purple gallery.
But only for a moment; the shrieks of delight
were smothered before they were well begun;
songs were sung, not shouted; clapping was
subdued to a ladylike volume. Miss Andrews
smiled approval at the purple gallery,
whereat the leading spirits ensconced there
winked joyously at one another. The plot
was auspiciously launched.</p>

<p>For perhaps three minutes after Miss Andrews
whistled the signal to the teams to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
“Play ball,” nothing particular happened.
The freshman center muffed outrageously, the
sophomore home barely missed making a goal,
and the freshman guards seized the opportunity
thus offered to do some very creditable
interfering, which the center’s stage-fright
rendered quite useless. The ball was back at
the sophomore basket, and the Invincible
home had poised it again for an easy toss.
Then there was a faint rustle in the purple
gallery, then a breathless “Ah!” of amazement
from the red one, followed by a suppressed
titter of amusement. The Invincible
home caught a hint of something in the air,
hesitated, tossed up the ball, and missed the
basket. In the mêlée that followed every
member of the Invincibles took a second off to
look around, and the freshmen scored. Whereupon
black Mandy’s Jim, whose striking costume
of white and purple stripes had made
his sudden appearance on the top rail of
the purple gallery all the more spectacular,
dropped back out of sight, before Miss Andrews
had as much as discovered his presence.
Annoyance and uncertainty as to what might
happen next beset the Invincibles. The freshmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
scored again. The purple gallery sang a
polite song of triumph, then sat back behind
the purple drapery and let the Invincibles
score twice. Just as the most uncertain of the
Invincible homes was about to score an inevitable
point, standing close under the basket,
something happened again. The voluminous
purple drapery straightened out taut, disclosing
itself as a huge purple banner with the
class numerals on it in white; and at regular
intervals on the white figures there were oval
openings through which purple-capped faces
popped out, grinning placidly across at the
agitated red gallery. There was another rustle,
a flutter, a giggle. The uncertain home missed
her sure throw, there was a long, futile scramble
for the ball, and Miss Andrews’s silver
whistle sounded the end of the half. Score
two to two.</p>

<p>Instantly the purple gallery broke out in
tuneful song, the sophomores in angry clamor.
An indignant sophomore deputation beset Miss
Andrews. The senior coaches came running
out to join it. The junior coaches smilingly
disclaimed all knowledge of the freshman
plot to rattle the Invincibles. Miss Andrews<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
had seen nothing; upon being enlightened
she summoned the freshman president, who
was also the leader of their music.</p>

<p>“But we aren’t breaking any rule,” that
budding diplomatist explained politely. “We
haven’t shrieked or clapped noisily,—or
stamped”—with a meaning glance at the
sophomore delegation, who blushed at the
veiled accusation. “Basket-ball is supposed
to teach self-control, isn’t it, Miss Andrews?
The Invincibles oughtn’t to pay any attention
to sophomore giggles. Of course if it is against
the rules to show extra mascots—— But the
sophomores shouted fearfully at first. That
was what rattled our center so.”</p>

<p>In the end the freshman president returned
in triumph to the purple gallery, where immediately
the purple banner was again spread out
to while away the tedium of the intermission.</p>

<p>“You’re smart, if you are mean,” Fluffy
Dutton called across the big gym. admiringly.</p>

<p>“Wait till you see the rest of our stunts,”
Montana Marie’s clear voice sang back. “I
guess you’ll think we’re smart before we’re
through. Well, rather!”</p>

<p>“Might as well enjoy whatever is doing,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
Fluffy advised her irate neighbors. “This
whole business just shows that they knew
they couldn’t possibly win in a straight game.
But it’s awfully clever.”</p>

<p>The Invincible team had arrived at the
same philosophical conclusion. When they
came back they bowed mockingly to the purple
gallery, and cheered, in pantomime, below
the mystic purple banner. They won a goal
in spite of the disconcerting appearance on the
freshman railing of a tiny yellow-haired child
dressed as a purple Queen of Hearts. But
when a whole family of white rabbits popped
out at once, in assorted sizes, across the length
of the purple gallery, they resigned themselves
good-naturedly to the loss of not one goal
only but two. When the banner unfurled
again, this time with rabbit heads in the oval
spaces, the prize center of the Invincibles
happened to be facing it, and, being already
half hysterical with weariness, she crumpled
up with mirth. Before her sub. could trot out
to the center field, the whistle had sounded
the end of the great game. Score five to four
in the freshmen’s favor, fouls accounting for
the extra points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“Do the stunts all over again and maybe
we’ll forgive you,” Fluffy sang across to the
purple gallery. After the mascots had appeared
once more, amid much applause, there
was a rush for the gym. floor.</p>

<p>The players were all carried round the gym.
on their partisans’ shoulders, and Montana
Marie O’Toole, smiling as serenely as though
it were an every-day occurrence, also got her
promised ride.</p>

<p>As she was let carefully down to the floor
again, she found herself face to face with
Straight Dutton.</p>

<p>“I say,” began Straight, “did you think of
all that nonsense?”</p>

<p>Marie flashed her a knowing smile. “You’re
too flattering, Miss Dutton, I assure you,” she
parried.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Straight with asperity.
“I think the whole performance was extra-specially
silly. It just spoiled the game.
You’ve won technically, of course, but not by
playing ball.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie thrust her smiling face,
topped by the huge purple bow, close to
Straight’s flushed, tired one. “Don’t you tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
a soul, and I’ll tell you a secret,” she whispered
impressively.</p>

<p>“Cross my heart,” promised Straight eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’m sorry you lost,” whispered
Montana Marie. “All my best friends are
seniors, and I hate to see them looking so blue.
Now don’t you tell!” Montana Marie joined
a band of dancing freshmen and was whisked
off down the gym.</p>

<p>Straight looked after her half admiringly,
half angrily. “Just the same I don’t believe
she thought it up. She’s the best bluffer that
ever came to Harding. Smile, look mysterious,
say nothing—that’s her trick-play, and it always
scores. I wonder why she was so crazy
to come to Harding. I certainly must ask
Betty if she ever has wondered why her freshman
was so stuck on Harding College.”</p>

<p>Then, as her twin rushed up with a reminder
that it was time to dress for the team dinner,
“Yes, Fluffy,” Straight answered absently,
“I’m coming this very minute. But I certainly
should like to know—nothing you can tell me,
Fluff; so don’t ask me to stop and explain.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>MONTANA MARIE AND THE PROM. MAN SUPPLY
COMPANY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Montana Marie</span> had dozens of invitations
to spend the spring vacation with college
friends. But she declined them all. “You
see, Ma misses me a lot,” she explained, “and
she’s been counting on coming East to help
me buy my spring clothes. So I guess I can’t
very well disappoint her.”</p>

<p>So Mrs. and Miss O’Toole became for a
week leading features of New York’s largest
and showiest hotel; and there various of
Marie’s New York friends, encountering the
pair in the corridors or the tea-room, or dining
wonderfully behind a screen of hovering
waiters, were treated to samples of Mrs.
O’Toole’s choice observations, couched in Mrs.
O’Toole’s choice English. Sometimes Marie
giggled amiably at her mother’s remarks, and
sometimes she explained “what Ma really
means to say.” But she never appeared embarrassed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
never showed annoyance, and never
though invitations were again showered upon
her, accepted one that did not include Mrs.
O’Toole.</p>

<p>“You see Ma’s been expecting a good time
this week,” she explained simply. “She’s
come way from California to see me, and so I
guess I can’t leave her alone much.”</p>

<p>And for every girl who made fun of Mrs.
O’Toole, there was another to defend Marie’s
loyalty; so that she went back for her spring
term at Harding more talked about than ever,
more laughed at, and more stoutly championed.</p>

<p>Having discovered the rules of true concentration,
Marie had plenty of time for recreation,
especially now that soft April breezes
had melted hard faculty hearts, and spring-term
standards made life easy. She entered
into all the season’s diversions with her customary
zest, but the event that fairly stirred
her soul was the junior prom. For one day—nay,
two,—the Harding campus would be
black with men! Montana Marie sighed joyously
at this pleasing prospect, and listened
eagerly to the plans, hopes, fears, and disappointments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
that preluded the great occasion.</p>

<p>Connie wasn’t going to the prom., Montana
Marie discovered to her horror. The
idea of missing your junior prom.!</p>

<p>“Why aren’t you going?” she demanded
incisively.</p>

<p>“Because I don’t know any man to ask,”
Connie replied with her usual directness.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” sighed Montana Marie.
“Why, I know dozens of men! I’ll get
you a man, and you can save me one little
dance in exchange for him. Do you prefer
that Winsted senior that Mr. Ford brought to
call on me last week—you saw him in the
parlor when you came down to dinner, so you
can size him up—or would you rather have a
man that I met when I was in New York?
They won’t want to go with you? Nonsense!
Any man wants to go to a Harding prom.
Give me two dances, if it will make you feel
any better about it.”</p>

<p>Connie’s good fortune having been noised
abroad, Georgia Ames made prompt application
for a man.</p>

<p>“They always let in a few seniors, you know,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
and I’m pining to be one of them. Ask the
New York man for me, and you can have
three perfectly good dances as your reward.”</p>

<p>“Done!” giggled Montana Marie joyously.
“Say, if I provided men for enough juniors
and seniors, why, I could get a whole program
of dances for myself, couldn’t I? I’m just
longing for a real man-dance. I went to one
in New York, and it just started me up.
Georgia, tell your nice junior friends about
me, won’t you? There’s a man in Chicago
that could come to this prom. as well as not,
and a man at Yale, and two in Malden, Mass.,
and—oh, well, just dozens of them. I’ve got
letters from most of them here. The girls can
read the letters and take their pick. Why,
this prom.’s going to be real exciting, if I am
only a little freshman that’s supposed to sit on
the fire-escape and watch the fun. You’re
sure there won’t be any trouble about smuggling
me in?”</p>

<p>Georgia was confident that there would not
be any trouble on that score. “You can be a
freshman waitress,” she explained. “You
would be anyway, because they always pick
out the prettiest ones to serve the lemonade.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
And then you can just abandon the lemonade,
and dance. It’s been done before now, I
guess.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie smiled engagingly. “If I
got an extra man for myself, why, then you
poor things wouldn’t have to sit out the dances
that you gave me.”</p>

<p>Georgia shook her head doubtfully at that
suggestion. “You’d better not try it. It’s
rather nice for us to sit out—gives us a chance
to cool off in peace now and then. Anyway,
freshman waitresses aren’t supposed to ask
men for themselves. You couldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Montana Marie complacently.
“I don’t want to do anything that
isn’t done. Georgia, how would you like a
Montana cowboy for your prom. man?”</p>

<p>“Depends on how well he can dance,”
Georgia parried.</p>

<p>“Oh, he can dance all right enough,” Montana
Marie assured her. “There’s only one
trouble——”</p>

<p>“Of course,” laughed Georgia. “The
trouble that’s common to all the nicest prom.
men. They can’t come.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’d come fast enough, if I asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
him,” Montana Marie declared easily. “He’d
come like lightning. But when he got here
I’m afraid he’d want at least six dances with
me. And that’s too much for any junior to
give up. So, as I can’t have an extra man
for myself, I can’t ask him.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” sympathized Georgia. “I’ll go
and tell some juniors about your Prom. Man
Supply Company. Are you sure the men’s
letters can be on exhibition?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” agreed Montana Marie carelessly.
“You see, I used to like some of those men
pretty well once on a time, but now—— Oh,
yes, they can choose by the letters if they
want to.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, no patron of the Prom.
Man Supply Company made use of the proprietor’s
private correspondence in making
her choice from the “dozens” of available
prom. men. They all left the question of
suitability to Marie, who discussed qualifications
at length with her patrons, considered
each case with the same care that she bestowed
on the intricacies of Latin prose, and sent off
her invitations-by-proxy with a confidence
that was the admiration of all beholders. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
her proverbial good luck held. All the men
that she asked promptly accepted; and to a
woman did each patron find satisfaction in her
allotment. The fee per man was necessarily
reduced to two dances, and counting in the
one dance promised to Jim Watson, who had
written to announce that he was coming up to
help Betty chaperon the party, Marie’s program
was full, except for supper and the last
dance; and Marie was the envy of her class,
and more of a celebrity than ever.</p>

<p>And then Marie was late for the first dance.
It had been such hard work introducing everybody
and arranging things, she explained
glibly, when she finally hurried in just in
time for one short turn around the hall with
Connie’s man from Winsted. She was wearing
a black and white dress, with touches of
vivid scarlet.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll find me all right for our
next dance,” she told the Winsted man gaily.
“You’d know this dress as far as you can see
it. That’s always one good thing about the
clothes Ma picks out for me.”</p>

<p>Then came Jim’s dance. Montana Marie
sweetly begged Betty to keep it for herself, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
when Betty laughingly declared that Jim had
made that waltz a condition of coming up for
the prom., she swept him off across the still
empty floor. Betty watched her vivid gown
weaving in and out in the crowd, as couple
after couple joined the dance, and then lost
sight of her, and forgot all about her, until
first Georgia, then Timmy Wentworth, and
next Connie, each followed by a dejected-looking
escort, came to ask if she had seen anything
of Montana Marie.</p>

<p>At the end of the second dance, it seemed,
Montana Marie O’Toole had vanished magically
from the junior prom. The men who
had gathered from near and far to bask in her
smiles, as their reward for doing escort duty to
her friends, departed with only one last tantalizing
glimpse of her. This they got when
she reappeared just in time to dance the last
waltz. She danced it with a man who had
not been invited to the prom. for any patroness
of the Prom. Man Supply Company. And
just before the music stopped she vanished
once more, not to reappear until the following
morning, when she achieved the masterly
feat of taking six men to chapel, and three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
others to breakfast afterward at the Tally-ho,
with complete satisfaction to all parties concerned.
It remained only to pacify the patronesses
of the Prom. Man Supply Company,
and to them she made full and unabashed explanation
of her conduct.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder you thought I was perfectly
outrageous, if you didn’t get any of my
messages. Why, I sent dozens of messages to
all of you! You see I felt horribly sick and
dizzy after the second dance—I thought of
course Mr. Watson noticed it. So I went out
to get some air. I came back after a while,
but the lights and the heat made me dreadfully
giddy again. So off I dashed. But I
did hate to miss everything, so I slipped in for
the last waltz. That man—oh, he wasn’t one
of the Prom. Man Supply ones. He was—well,
you pick out the most unselfish junior
you can think of,—one who’d be capable of
giving up her last beautiful prom. waltz to a
poor unfortunate little freshman,—and maybe
you’ll guess right.”</p>

<p>“Did you have a good supper?” asked
Timmy Wentworth abruptly. She had heard
strange rumors of a waiter’s having been exorbitantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
tipped by a couple who had bribed
him to bring their supper down to the apple
orchard.</p>

<p>Montana Marie laughed delightedly.
“How did you know about that?” she demanded.
“I didn’t eat any dinner because
I’d been to so many prom. teas in the afternoon;
but when I began to feel queer in the
evening, I thought perhaps a cup of coffee
and a sandwich would do me good. So I got
a nice waiter to bring me some outside.
Wasn’t that all right? Weren’t there coffee
and sandwiches enough to go round?”</p>

<p>Timmy nodded, smiling a sarcastic little
smile. “Plenty, thank you. Was the man
in the hammock, who helped you get and eat
the sandwich, also lent by that same very accommodating
junior?”</p>

<p>Montana Marie stared in offended dignity.
“Wouldn’t almost any junior, especially
those that I’d asked men for, be pleased to
lend me a man to find a waiter and then show
him where I was sitting out in the orchard—feeling
quite ill and giddy?” Montana
Marie’s tone changed suddenly, growing soft
and persuasive. “Say, I almost forgot to tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
you what George Dorsey said about you. He
said that you were just exactly his ideal of an
American college girl, and he hopes to come
up here again next month.”</p>

<p>Timmy Wentworth smiled—this time cordially.
For she had found George Dorsey a
very satisfactory example of the American
college man. “He said something to me
about motoring up in June,” she admitted,
“and I hope he will. He’s very nice, if he
is an arrant flatterer. I’m really ever so much
obliged to you, Marie, for asking him up for
me. Come to dinner to-night, and I’ll tell
you all the jists that happened.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to bother her any more
about how she spent her evening,” Timmy
told Georgia later. “It was slightly embarrassing
for a few minutes, consoling poor Mr.
Dorsey for the loss of the only two dances
that he specially wanted. But that’s over
and done with now, and the way she acted is
her own affair.”</p>

<p>“I hate a person who cuts dances,” declared
honest Georgia bluntly.</p>

<p>“Maybe she did really feel ill.”</p>

<p>“She seems to have felt like flirting around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
in the moonlight. Eugenia Ford saw her
holding hands on the Morton steps.”</p>

<p>“With the same mysterious man?”</p>

<p>“Eugenia couldn’t be sure.”</p>

<p>“Whose was he, I wonder? He was
nothing so much of a dancer.”</p>

<p>“He looked nice and big and brown and
jolly.”</p>

<p>“And he never took his eyes off Marie
once. That was the principal thing I noticed
about him.”</p>

<p>Timmy’s generous attitude toward the manager
of the Prom. Man Supply Company was
promptly adopted by the other patronesses.
So easily placated, indeed, and so agreeable
were they, that Montana Marie, who had
basely deceived them with half truths and
timely repetitions of vain compliments, was
speedily stricken with remorse. A few days
after the prom. she sought out Betty, and told
her all about it.</p>

<p>“You see, Miss Wales, I did feel ill. I’d
worried so about all those men, and I’d talked
so hard all the afternoon. And then a man
from home came to see me—somebody I know
awfully well. Of course he wanted to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
to the prom., but Georgia had said I couldn’t
have anybody, so—well, I couldn’t be rude
and leave him. I just told him I didn’t care
about the prom. You see, Miss Wales, even
if I’d smuggled him in, I hadn’t any dances
left for him—but two. And that isn’t his
idea of going to a dance with me. So we just
wandered around in the cool, and Fred got a
waiter to bring us elegant things to eat, and
when the last dance came we just calmly
walked in—all the ushers and doorkeepers
had gone away by that time. We simply
couldn’t resist that music. And I’ve let them
suppose, Miss Wales,—I’ve pretty nearly said
to those other girls that I cut dances with,—that
some junior gave up her last dance and
her man to me. Do you think that was perfectly
horrid of me, Miss Wales?”</p>

<p>“Of course I think it’s always better to tell
things just as they are.” Betty tried to be
tactful and truthful at once.</p>

<p>Marie nodded vigorous agreement. “I
should say it is. You get all tangled up and
ashamed of yourself when you try to fix up a
good story. You see, Miss Wales, I wrote
Fred about the prom., and about the men I’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
asked for those juniors, and he just up and
came himself. I didn’t ask him. I especially
explained that I couldn’t ask any one for
myself. But he was bound to come along just
the same.”</p>

<p>“Rather a long trip, wasn’t it?” asked Betty,
feeling her way a little.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, he’s going to stay East quite a
while, I guess,” Marie told her.</p>

<p>And then for no reason at all Marie blushed
furiously, laughed at herself for blushing, and
finally explained that Fred had never been
’way East before and it made her laugh to remember
the comical things he had told about
his long journey. “He’s in New York now,”
she went on. “I expect he’s doing the town
in real cowboy and miner style. He’s a sure
enough cowboy and miner, Miss Wales.”</p>

<p>“Is he coming up here again?” asked
Betty, just to show an interest.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Montana Marie
gaily. Then she flushed and laughed again.
“If you want my honest opinion, I should say
that he very likely is. Now I’ll go and make
myself square with Georgia and Miss Wentworth
and the rest of them. They are awfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
easy marks, or they’d have seen through me.
Good-bye, Miss Wales. No warnings so far,
and concentration is working to the queen’s
taste.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>ENTERTAINING GEORGIA’S SISTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgia Ames</span> was blue about something.
As the spring term wore on toward June she
grew absent and pensive to a marked degree. It
wasn’t that she was a senior; Georgia Ames
wasn’t the sort to mope because college was almost
over for her. Besides, she and Lucile Merrifield
and the Dutton twins were going to
Lucile’s camp in the Maine woods for a long,
blissful summer. That certainly wasn’t a
prospect to make you dread the plunge into
the wide, wide world. It was only the girls
who didn’t know what was coming next, or
who knew and didn’t like it, who moped
through their last spring term.</p>

<p>The Duttons were pathetically worried
about Georgia’s low spirits. Straight suggested
a doctor; Fluffy adroitly sounded Georgia on
the subject of conditions, and discussed the
ethics of “flunking out” seniors exhaustively,
until Georgia suggested mildly that the subject
wasn’t of any great interest to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“I’m thankful to say I’ve never had to
worry about flunking,” she said, “and none of
our crowd has either—oh, I forgot Eugenia
Ford when she was a freshman. But that was
pure silliness.”</p>

<p>So the matter of conditions was definitely
eliminated.</p>

<p>“Maybe she’s in love,” suggested Montana
Marie, who was present one day when the subject
was discussed. “Being in love makes
you feel—well, queer. And if it’s not returned——”</p>

<p>“What a little goose you are, Marie, on the
subject of men,” Timmy Wentworth told her
shortly. “No sensible girl like G. Ames goes
around wearing her heart on her sleeve. Besides,
Georgia doesn’t care for men at all. She
often says that she came to college in the first
place because there wouldn’t be any men
around.”</p>

<p>“She did!” sighed Montana Marie. “What
a queer reason! I——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, do tell us why you came,” Straight
Dutton broke in, as Marie hesitated.</p>

<p>“Why I came?” repeated Marie gaily.
“Oh, yes, I’ll tell you that with pleasure. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
came to complete my education, of course.”
When Straight gave a disappointed little
shrug, Marie giggled riotously. “Sorry you
don’t like my reason,” she concluded, drawing
down the corners of her pretty mouth in an
absurd imitation of extreme grief.</p>

<p>It was little Binks Ames, with her queer
talent for making strange discoveries, who
finally found out what was worrying Georgia.
And she took the matter to the most wonderful
person about troubles that she knew:
namely, Miss Betty Wales.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Binks solemnly, “Constance
Ames is the pretty, society kind of girl. But
she’s awfully bright, too. She’s five years
younger than Georgia; so she’ll be a year
younger in entering college. That is, if she
will come, when she’s ready, in the fall. But
she won’t. She has an idea that college is
awfully solemn and serious and studious, and
she says she’d rather go to boarding-school,
where the girls are lively, even if there are a
lot of rules. And Georgia feels dreadfully.
She’s always thought it would be such fun
having Constance here after she’s graduated.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be here, anyway,” laughed Betty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“Oh, but I don’t count,” little Binks explained
quite seriously. “At least not like a
younger sister that you can come up with in
September, and send boxes to, and introduce
to your friends, and talk it all over with in
vacations. Besides, I’m—I’m queer. So I
don’t really count at all.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Betty was as serious as Binks.
“Why doesn’t Georgia have her little sister
up here for a visit? She’d be sure to have a
splendid time, and then she’d want to enter
college. Has she put in her application for
the campus?”</p>

<p>Binks nodded. “Georgia did it for her the
minute she saw how nice Harding is. The
reason Georgia doesn’t have her up is because
she’s afraid to. You see, Constance belongs to
a crowd of boys and girls who have a lot going
on all the time, and Georgia is afraid—well,
to tell the truth, Constance is man-crazy. She
doesn’t think you can have a good time with
just girls. And of course when you don’t expect
a good time and act offish and disagreeable,
why, you don’t have a good time,” ended
Binks acutely.</p>

<p>Betty nodded. “And Georgia is afraid Constance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
would feel and act that way if she came
for the visit. She might, of course. I don’t
quite see what I can do about it, but I’ll think.
I certainly ought to come to Georgia’s rescue
once, when she’s always coming to mine.”</p>

<p>“She was just awfully proud of being elected
Georgia-to-the-Rescue,” confided Binks. “She
said she was as proud of that as of being taken
into Dramatic Club.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Betty flushed with pleasure.
“What a foolish, sweet way to feel about just
helping me! Well, I’ll think hard about the
man-struck Constance. We’ll both think
hard, and perhaps we can think of a way to
rescue Georgia.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure you can,” said Binks with
touching confidence. “The thing to do is to
make Constance expect a good time, isn’t it,
Miss Wales? Because then she couldn’t help
liking Harding, especially in spring term.”</p>

<p>Yes, that was clearly the thing to do, Betty
agreed, and Binks, remembering suddenly
that Miss Wales was very busy and quite
capable of making her own deductions about
what to do in regard to Constance, took a
blushing departure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>That same afternoon the B. C. A.’s gathered
informally in the top story of the Peter Pan
annex; and when the matter of Georgia’s
blues came up, Betty told them in confidence
what Binks had discovered.</p>

<p>“Whatever is done will have to be done
right away,” she added, “because campus
rooms are assigned early in June, and when
Constance gets hers I suppose she will give it
up. If she should change her mind later
about coming to college, she couldn’t get back
her chance at the room. She would have to
apply all over again, and that means that she
wouldn’t be on the campus before her senior
year, if she was then.”</p>

<p>“Foolish young Constance!” said Mary
scornfully. “The idea of thinking that Harding
girls are less fun than boarding-school
chits.”</p>

<p>“The idea of thinking that there isn’t time
enough later on for men,” sniffed Babbie,
playing with her engagement ring.</p>

<p>“The idea of thinking that she won’t change
her mind about men and most other things,
while she’s here,” added little Helen Adams,
with a comical air of vast experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“Georgia ought to be game and take the
risk of having foolish young Constance up for
a week,” declared Christy Mason. “We’d get
her so properly excited that she’d forget the
name of her best particular suitor.”</p>

<p>Madeline listened to these comments with
an air of polite detachment. Finally she rose
from her place and crawled over Betty to the
Peter Pan staircase. “Talk about something
else until I get back,” she ordered. “I’m
going down to the Tally-ho desk to write a
letter for Georgia to send to Constance.”</p>

<p>It was fully twenty minutes before Madeline
reappeared, waving the letter in her hand.</p>

<p>“Want to hear it?” she asked. “It’s nothing
much, but I’m pretty sure it will get young
Constance. Listen now, and don’t ask questions,
because I won’t answer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Constance</span>:</p>

<p>“Can’t you come up next Thursday for
a week? I shall be rather busy then—seniors
are terribly busy in spring term (having a
good time)—but Billy Barstow is to be here
that week, and is crazy to meet you and show
you the place. Timmy Wentworth wants to
take you canoeing. Dickie Drake is coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
up to see a sister or a cousin or something, and
you two can go buggy-riding mornings, while
cousin and I are at classes. (Of course you
know you’re not allowed to go buggy-riding
with a man after you enter.) You’re also invited
to a fraternity dance at Winsted,—not
particularly exciting; so perhaps, unless
you’re coming up next year and want to meet
some Winsted men, it wouldn’t pay you to go.
Let me know whether to accept for you.</p>

<p>“But at all events, don’t fail to come up.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Georgia.</span></p>

<p>“P. S.—Of course all my friends are planning
to do things for you. Don’t let them
know that girls bore you, because it would
hurt their feelings so.”</p>
</div>

<p>Madeline folded the letter carefully and
tucked it up her sleeve for safe-keeping.
“Rather nice on the whole, isn’t it?” she said.
“It does just what Binks astutely pointed out
must be done. It brings young Constance to
Harding in an expectant and receptive frame
of mind.”</p>

<p>“She may be angry when she finds she’s
been fooled,” suggested Christy.</p>

<p>Madeline stared at her blankly. “You
don’t really mean,” she began at last, “that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
you doubt the combined ability of the B. C.
A.’s, Timmy Wentworth, Dickie Drake, Billy
Barstow, the Dutton twins, and the best frat.
in Winsted to give foolish young Constance
the time of her gay young life? If she is any
kind of a girl she will think we’re the very
best jokers she ever heard of. The Duttons
are down in the Tally-ho waiting to carry the
letter to Georgia, and if she likes the idea
they’re going to take charge of the program—select
entertainers, assign stunts and hours,
and all that. Eugenia Ford is going to attend
to the Winsted end. There’s no fooling
about that dance, Christy. It’s the most
gorgeous affair of the Winsted season, Eugenia
says, and she is sure she can get an invitation
for Constance. Any more objections?”</p>

<p>There were no more objections. As the full
beauty of Madeline’s plan dawned upon the
other B. C. A.’s, there were shrieks of delight,
offers of assistance, and suggestions for novel
stunts likely to appeal particularly to the
temperament of foolish young Constance.
Presently the Duttons trilled from below, and
the letter was ceremoniously lowered in the
Peter Pan basket, amid great excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>“We forgot Bob Blake,” Straight called up.
“She’ll be splendid to help.”</p>

<p>“All right, but don’t alter the letter. We
can mention her at the station,” Madeline
called down; and the twins and Eugenia
hurried off to the Belden to find Georgia.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was on the loveliest of May afternoons, a
week later, that Constance Ames alighted
with much youthful dignity from the Boston
train, to find herself fairly surrounded by a
noisy bevy of girls,—girls quite as pretty and
quite as stylish as young Constance, girls
whose flattering speeches of welcome made her
blush, whose jokes made her laugh, and whose
breezy energy packed her and her bag, together
with six or seven of themselves, into a
trim runabout and rushed her off to the
Tally-ho for refreshment, before she had
had time to explain that she was hot and
dusty and would rather go straight to her
room,—before she met any more girls or any
men.</p>

<p>The Tally-ho was so fascinating and the
food so good that Constance decided not to say
anything about leaving in a hurry. And then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
all at once the Dutton twins, whom chemistry
lab. had prevented from meeting Constance
at the station, burst upon the scene.</p>

<p>“Eugenia Ford has a car up for the rest of
the term—a big snorting red one, with a
rumbly horn and a funny French chauffeur.
She wants any ten of us to go riding in it, in
honor of Georgia’s sister.”</p>

<p>“How do you do, Georgia’s sister?” added
Straight gravely. “Awfully nice to have
you here to give parties for. Eugenia has an
extra veil in the car for you. She says for
everybody to leave their hats here, to save
room.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have eats at Mossy Glen.”</p>

<p>“Who’s seen to the food?”</p>

<p>“Over the Notch by moonlight and home
through Winsted, to let John Ford see his
little cousin splurge. She’s telephoned him
to be on the watch for us.”</p>

<p>“Timmy Wentworth can’t get away this
evening to go canoeing, so Eugenia’s party
just fits in.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t Miss Constance Ames like a
wash and a brush in Betty’s private dressing
room? She looks extra-specially spick and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
span, but traveling in the heat always makes
a person feel messy.”</p>

<p>Constance went off with Betty and Madeline,
and Georgia went out to break the news
to Eugenia that Constance generally took
hours and hours to prink up. To her amazement
and relief Constance appeared within
five minutes.</p>

<p>During the ride there were frequent, though
vague, references to Timmy and Dick and
Billy. Everybody in the party seemed to
know and like them, and they seemed to have
planned all sorts of delightful entertainment
for Constance. Timmy, Fluffy Dutton declared
solemnly, would be simply heart-broken
at having to postpone the canoeing trip on
Paradise, which had been planned for the first
evening of Constance’s visit.</p>

<p>“I’m having a beautiful time, all the same,”
Constance assured Fluffy eagerly. “I just
love motoring. And I’m very anxious to see
Winsted.”</p>

<p>But a bad puncture, necessitating a long
delay, put the détour to Winsted out of the
evening’s program. How much Madeline’s
firm determination that Winsted should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
kept for the dessert of Constance’s visit, as it
were, had to do with the French chauffeur’s
deliberation in repairing the puncture, is a
matter for idle speculation.</p>

<p>Next morning Constance was awakened
with a start by a huge bunch of wild forget-me-nots,
which hurtled in at her window, and
plopped down beside her on the bed.</p>

<p>“How lovely!” murmured Constance,
burying her face in the big blue bouquet.
“And a note hidden in them! What fun!
Just like a story.”</p>

<p>The note was from Timmy Wentworth.
“Your sister is busy all this morning. She
says you are to take breakfast at nine at
Cuyler’s with the Misses Dutton. They will
call for you. At ten won’t you meet me at
the boat-house for our paddle? It will give
me such pleasure. Timmy Wentworth.”</p>

<p>Constance dressed with eager haste. The
Duttons were in their liveliest mood. Cuyler’s
waffles fairly melted in your mouth.
And at ten she was going canoeing with
Timmy Wentworth!</p>

<p>The Duttons escorted her as far as the top
of Observatory Hill, and having pointed out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
the boat-house, departed unceremoniously for
a ten o’clock quiz. Constance consulted a
tiny mirror that hung from her silver chain,
smoothed her hair, straightened her coat
collar, and walked leisurely down, through
the campus gardens and past the famous frog
pond, to Paradise. At the top of the boat-house
stairs she paused and looked to see if
Timmy was waiting. It was too dark inside
the boat-house to see any one, but on the railing
perched a tall, merry-faced girl in a blue
and white jumper, who waved friendly greetings.
She must have been one of the crowd
at the station, Constance reflected, and she
waved back cordially as she hurried down the
stairs.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_240">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_240.jpg" alt="A TALL, MERRY-FACED GIRL">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">A TALL, MERRY-FACED GIRL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Lovely day, isn’t it?” The tall girl’s
firm hand-shake made Constance wince.
“And the woods are full of flowers. Fluffy
and I were out before breakfast getting a boatful
for the Belden House senior tea. We stole
out a bunch for you. Shall we be off?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” stammered Constance. “That is,
I was expecting——”</p>

<p>“How stupid!” broke in the tall girl
eagerly. “I forgot to say that I’m Felicia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
Wentworth, commonly known as Timmy for
no reason under the sun. Now shall we be
off?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Constance hastily, too proud
to show either astonishment or disappointment.
It was an entertaining trip, too, in
spite of everything. Timmy was not at all
Constance’s idea of a college grind. She had
just come back from a Dartmouth prom. She
was going home next Saturday to see about
her junior usher dress, and incidentally to
star in an amateur vaudeville performance at
the Country Club her family belonged to. It
appeared that amateur vaudeville shows,
tennis, canoeing, and going to “stunty”
house-parties—she was going to “a duck of
a one” in June—were Timmy’s chief diversions.
Yet she confided to Constance that she
was hoping hard to make the Phi Kappa
honor list next year, and that she had spent
the previous afternoon in “digging fiercely”
on a philosophy paper, because “if you had a
good head for books what was the use of muddling
along?”</p>

<p>“The fun here is in pulling off the work
and still getting in the fun,” she assured Constance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
paddling up a tiny bay, whose banks
were blue with forget-me-nots. Timmy
dropped her paddle, brushed the hair out of
her eyes, and smiled engagingly at young
Constance. “You understand what I mean,
of course,” she flattered adroitly. “I can see
that you’re not the muddling kind. Anyway
Georgia says you are very clever. Well, all I
say is, look at me and don’t worry about the
good times we have. Now shall we get the
Belden a little more forget-me-not for its sentimental
senior party?”</p>

<p>Constance spoke enthusiastically to Georgia
of Paradise and Miss Wentworth. She
dropped not a hint of surprises or disappointments.
That afternoon Billy Barstow, a
petite, pretty sophomore, with a distinctly
frivolous air, took Constance for a stroll
round the campus. It was hot, and they
spent most of the time in the gym. basement,
watching the divers in the swimming-tank
and exchanging confidences about many
things. Billy was secretly bored, but she concealed
it so well that Constance decided Billy
should be her first crush. Billy had put this
idea into her head by explaining how Georgia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
had been her first crush. Dickie Drake appeared
a day or two later. She wasn’t pretty,
but she was very distinguished-looking, Constance
decided. She was also engaged, and
willing to talk about Tom to anybody who
would listen,—even to Georgia’s sub-freshman
sister.</p>

<p>“She’ll get her self-consciousness knocked
out of her in short order up here,” Dick assured
the cousin whom she had come to visit.
“And then she’ll be a very nice child.
Remember what a detestable little prig I
was when I came up—a snob and man-crazy
and insufferably lazy. And they turned me
out a rather decent sort—not half good enough
for Tom, but much improved.”</p>

<p>Everybody agreed that young Constance
showed the proper spirit in ignoring the base
deception that had been practiced upon her,
and in appearing to enjoy every minute of her
week in Harding. Even the stony-hearted
Madeline admitted that she had richly earned
her Winsted dessert. And so the most select
frat. in Winsted found its end-of-the-season
dance mysteriously turned into an ovation
for a pretty sub-freshman friend of Eugenia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
Ford’s. As the sub-freshman was undeniably
a “winner,” the frat. forgave John Ford for
making such a fuss about her, and promptly
added her name to the next year’s guest-list.
Which meant that foolish young Constance
would not pine away for lack of masculine
society, if she decided to enter Harding in the
fall.</p>

<p>“It’s queer about nicknames,” said Straight
Dutton, waving her handkerchief after Constance’s
Boston-bound train. “It’s queer how
many nicest girls get tagged with boys’ names.
Young Constance has confided to Georgia that
she’ll have a try at Harding. Now what got
her was that Timmy and Dickie and Bill and
Bob Blake are all the finest ever. If they
hadn’t been, everything would have gone
to smash. It’s certainly queer how many
nicest girls get nicknamed Bob and Bill and
Dickie.”</p>

<p>“The reason,” said Madeline wisely, “is
that the very nicest girls are all-around nice—not
sissy nice, or young-lady nice, or clever
nice, but nice every way,—and just as good
fun to play about with as any man in the
world. And the rest of us notice that, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
stopping to analyze it, and call them Bob
or Billy.”</p>

<p>“Um—maybe you’re right,” said Straight
slowly. “I presume you are. All I know
for sure is that we’ve scored. Hurray for
Billy and Bob and Dickie and Timmy!
Hurrah for we, us, and company that planned
it all! Hurray for Harding!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>THE NEW WOMAN AT HARDING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Goodness!</span> I’m glad I elected this sociology
course.” Fluffy Dutton precipitated
herself through the half-open door of Timmy
Wentworth’s big corner double (universally
called Timmy’s room, though half of it, of
course, belonged to Sallie Wright), tossed her
note-book on the table, dexterously extracted
two fat cushions from behind Eugenia Ford’s
head, and as dexterously inserted them and
herself on Sallie’s couch, in a practically invisible
vacancy between Straight and Montana
Marie O’Toole. There were plenty of other
seats to choose from, but Fluffy was intent on
securing a central position as regards both the
conversation and the refreshments which her
keen eyes had detected in Susanna Hart’s lap.</p>

<p>There were loud remonstrances from Eugenia
and Straight, amused giggles from Montana
Marie, and then, because it was a hot,
unprofitable May day, with “absolutely nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
doing,” as Straight had just remarked,
objections to Fluffy’s high-handed conduct
subsided in favor of an interest in Fluffy’s
sudden and amazing fondness for sociology.</p>

<p>“But you’ve said right along that you
hated it because it came in the afternoon,”
Eugenia reminded her.</p>

<p>“And because of all the reference reading,”
added Straight.</p>

<p>“And the awful way Miss Seaton does her
hair,” put in Montana Marie, with another
giggle.</p>

<p>“Frivolous objections, all of them.” Fluffy
reached a long arm for the candy. “Miss
Seaton is a fright, and the library ought to
buy more books and save us the nerve-racking
scramble for them. And it’s a burning
shame to put a course as important as this
one at such an absurd hour. But just the
same”—Fluffy’s manner took on the patronizing
air of the over-indulged, because soon-departing
senior—“just the same I advise all
you juniors and sophs, and you, Montana
Marie, if you ever should get to be a senior,
to elect sociology and find out a few things
about this woman question.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>“This woman question!” repeated Susanna
Hart scornfully. “Do you mean equal suffrage
and all sorts of other boring subjects like
that?”</p>

<p>Fluffy waited to finish a large mouthful.
“Suffrage isn’t a bore. It’s a matter that every
intelligent woman ought to think about at
least.”</p>

<p>“Don’t quote Celissa Seaton, Fluffy,”
Straight told her severely. “Her style of
oratory doesn’t suit you at all. No matter
how long you live, nor how frightfully you
get to doing up your back hair, you’ll never
pass for the intellectual woman type, I’m
happy to say.”</p>

<p>“There you are again!” objected Fluffy
eagerly. “Mixing up pretty clothes and a
talent for making smooth and becoming puffs
with baby-doll brains. Intelligent women
nowadays aren’t dowds, Straight.”</p>

<p>“Some are. Example, Miss Celissa Seaton,”
retorted Straight promptly.</p>

<p>“Go it, twins.” Montana Marie passed the
candy to the combatants impartially, but
Fluffy refused it and sat up with dignity
against her stolen cushions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>“Honestly, girls, I’m serious about this
sociology. When you’re almost through
college, you look back over the work you’ve
had, and wish you could remember more
about it, and are pretty sure that you’ll remember
a lot less before long, and anyway
that a lot of it hasn’t much to do with real
life. Greek prose, for instance, and trig. and—syllogisms.”</p>

<p>“I certainly hope I shan’t encounter any
syllogisms in real life,” put in Straight fervently.
“Because if I do, there’s one thing
certain; they’ll be sure to come out wrong and
leave me in a fix.”</p>

<p>“But you’re glad of all the poetry you’ve
learned to like,” went on Fluffy, “and of the
serious reading you’ve done and got off your
mind for good. And the history and civil
government will come in handy in polite conversation.
But for real, downright, sit-up-and-take-notice
interest, give me this sociology
business. I tell you it sets a person thinking!
If it didn’t make me sort of faint to poke
around in dirty, smelly places, I believe I
should take up settlement work next winter.
Lots of the girls in the class want to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“Is sociology all about poor people?” inquired
Timmy Wentworth. “Because I think
myself that rich people are just exactly as
interesting. Unless poor people are funny
enough to make you laugh I think they’re
often very dull indeed. Consequently I
don’t believe settlement work is all fun and
frolic.”</p>

<p>“It’s about both rich and poor people,” explained
Fluffy patiently. “But it hasn’t anything
much to do with their being bright or
stupid. That comes in psych. mostly—people’s
minds. It’s more about,—well, their all
getting their rights, you know, and having a
fair chance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and the woman question means
woman’s rights, I suppose,” piped up Susanna
Hart, still scornfully.</p>

<p>“Well, you want your rights, don’t you?”
Straight demanded, coming to Fluffy’s rescue,
as she always did the minute an outsider
attacked her sister. “I never noticed you
giving away bath hours or chances at library
books, and your reputation as a freshman
roommate——” Straight paused and smiled
meaningly around the circle. “No use raking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
up last year’s scandal,” she ended mildly,
perceiving from Susanna’s flushed face that
she had scored.</p>

<p>“Well, but that’s different, Straight,” protested
Susanna, humbled, but not ready to
yield her point. “Of course I take what’s
coming to me. I certainly don’t intend to lie
down and be walked over by—by anybody.”
Susanna clenched her small hands wrathfully,
as she remembered the tyrannical last year’s
roommate. “I didn’t mean to be more
disagreeable about it than I had to, but I
want——”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” popped in Straight coolly.
“You want your rights.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want to vote,” snapped Susanna,
“and I think suffragists are horrid
bores.”</p>

<p>“How many do you know, Susanna?” inquired
Fluffy sweetly.</p>

<p>“Celissa Seaton and—you,” retorted Susanna.
“Of course you’re not a bore in general,
Fluffy dear, but if you’re going off on
that horrid subject——”</p>

<p>“Well, of course I can’t talk very interestingly
about it,” Fluffy conceded diplomatically.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
“I don’t know enough to. But you
should hear Miss Seaton. You’d have to find
some other word besides bore to express your
opinion of her, because you simply couldn’t
call her that. She gets all pink and excited,
and she looks positively pretty in spite of her
hair. Don’t you know how Miss Ferris is
always saying that everybody is interesting if
you can only find the right thing to talk
about? Well, Miss Seaton is just splendid on
the woman question.”</p>

<p>“And are you really a suffragist, Fluffy?”
inquired Sallie Wright, in an awestruck voice.
Not being at all clever herself, Sallie admired
the Duttons from a safe distance, and spent
hours pondering over their idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>“Oh, not so you’d notice it,” Fluffy told
her. “Sorry to reduce the number of your
suffragist friends to one, Susanna; but I’m still
on the fence. I’ve chosen the anti-suffrage
position for my final essay in the course, but
so far, I may say, the arguments look to me
pretty slim. If any idiotic man can vote, why
in the world shouldn’t we?”</p>

<p>“I thought Montana Marie’s extra-special
show settled all that foolishness,” said Timmy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
Wentworth. “It made fun of all those queer
advanced notions, specially suffrage, and as
far as I could see it did ’em up brown.”</p>

<p>Fluffy sighed again patiently. “There you
go again. It made fun! You can make fun
of anything—anything under the sun. But
what have you proved? What did that silly
suffrage skit prove? What did our ‘Before
Breakfast, Never After’ farce prove? Nothing!”
concluded Fluffy dramatically.</p>

<p>“Well, they were certainly oceans of fun,”
declared Sallie Wright feelingly.</p>

<p>“And apparently they did oceans of harm,”
Fluffy took her up, “if they gave you and
Timmy and all your little pals the idea that
nonsense like that is any real argument
against the sensible modern ideas about
women. Miss Seaton felt that way about the
show, but I thought she was dippy. Now I’m
almost sorry I went in for it.”</p>

<p>“I believe Fluff’s got a crush on Celissa
Seaton,” Straight called across Fluffy in a
stage whisper directed at Montana Marie. Before
Fluffy had time to retort, the door opened
and Georgia Ames appeared.</p>

<p>“Oh, Georgia!” Fluffy welcomed her with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
enthusiasm. “Come and help me explain
about sociology to these infants.”</p>

<p>Georgia grinned cheerfully around the circle,
dropped down Turk-fashion on the floor
by the window, emptied the candy-box of its
small remaining store, and complied in her
usual effective fashion with Fluffy’s request.
“Celissa Seaton is certainly making a hit this
term. I’ve just come from a wild sociological
discussion on the shores of the swimming
tank. We about decided to organize a College
Woman’s Rights Club. Let’s do it right now,
and get ahead of that other bunch.”</p>

<p>“Splendid!” cried Susanna Hart traitorously.
Susanna knew when she was beaten,
and she had no desire to lead a lost cause
against Georgia and the twins. “I just love
to help organize things.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” agreed Montana Marie. “Only
why not organize something a little more
amusing, while we’re about it? Eating is the
feature of clubs that always appeals most to
me.”</p>

<p>“But there’s no point in organizing anything
amusing at this late date,” Straight explained.
“That is, not for us seniors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>“Besides, we’ve done plenty of that sort of
thing before,” added Georgia. “We’ve bequeathed
any number of amusing organizations
to Harding. Now we propose to bequeath
something useful.”</p>

<p>“And of course we depend on the rest of
you to keep it going when we’re gone,” added
Fluffy, smiling seductively at Susanna.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the little sophomore.</p>

<p>“We’re all for it, if you say the word,” put
in Timmy.</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best,” promised Sallie, who had
only the vaguest idea of Georgia’s intentions.</p>

<p>“I guess I should do better if we had real
eats at the first meeting,” giggled Montana
Marie.</p>

<p>No one paid any attention to her frivolity.
Susanna wondered politely why college girls
should bother about votes, when of course
they couldn’t vote yet a while. Georgia explained
that working women’s rights were just
as interesting and important as suffrage, and
that anyway the projected organization was to
begin right at home, with the problems of college
life.</p>

<p>“You see,” she explained, “if women are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
maybe going to vote and to learn how to run
unions and protect their own interests and
look out for their children, why, of course we
college people ought to be ready to take hold.
But how can we, if we’ve never had any experience
in sticking together and thinking about
the public good? So what we thought of—only
I was just going to explain it all out
nicely when most of the crowd had to go up
to a mob rehearsal for the senior play—what
we thought of was to form a self-government
association, to make rules for the college and
arrange to carry them out, and—oh, just generally
run the ship of state.”</p>

<p>“What gorgeousness!” Straight gave a
long sigh of admiration. “Why couldn’t you
think of an elegant scheme like that while we
were on hand to profit by it? Freshman year
was the time for a thing like that.”</p>

<p>“But we hadn’t had sociology then,” chorused
Georgia and Fluffy apologetically.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let’s organize it now,” pleaded
Straight. “It’s bad enough to be almost
through Harding, and I simply couldn’t bear
it if I thought that those”—waving comprehensively
at the lower class girls—“were still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
here, going to bed when they were sleepy, and
not bothering about cuts or study-hours or any
of the other trifling annoyances of Harding
life.”</p>

<p>“And the next year’s freshmen can sit on
the note-room table if they want to,” giggled
Montana Marie joyously.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Susanna Hart told her sternly.
“That’s not a regular rule; it’s an unwritten
law, and you can’t change it any more than
you can change the color of your hair.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Montana Marie slowly. “They
write down the rules that everybody knows,
and the ones that——”</p>

<p>“They don’t actually write down any of the
rules,” interrupted Susanna tartly, annoyed at
being caught in a contradiction.</p>

<p>“Oh!” repeated Montana Marie. “That’s
the real difference between college and boarding-school,
isn’t it? I’m glad I’ve found out
about that at last. But if they’re all unwritten
rules, and unwritten rules can’t be changed,
what will be the use of your club? Oh, dear,
I promised to be home at five, so I can’t wait
to have you explain.”</p>

<p>“Come to the grand rally to-morrow afternoon,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
Georgia ordered, “and everything will
be revealed. We’ll depend on you to get out
all the freshmen.”</p>

<p>The next day it rained—a fact which, combined
with Montana Marie’s industry in
stirring up the freshmen, and with the prevalent
interest in self-government, to produce a
mammoth mass-meeting. The Dutton twins,
whose method of getting things done, inherited
from Madeline Ayres, was to make
them seem exclusive and therefore highly
desirable, sat in the back row and scoffed at
the earnestness with which small points were
debated, and at the absurd length of time it
took to adopt a simple constitution and
elect the smallest possible quota of officers.
Georgia Ames was made president. The
Duttons resented the reproachful way she
stared at them when she introduced Miss
Seaton, who spoke on the modern woman
so exhaustively that even the admiring
Fluffy was finally caught yawning. Next
came Betty Wales, who, trying to be brief,
left her hearers somewhat confused about
the status of self-government, as she had
officially investigated it in other colleges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
for women. And then even the Duttons
ceased fidgeting, and, like the other chief
organizers, waited breathlessly for Georgia’s
next announcement, on which, to the initiated,
everything depended; Georgia was to appoint
the executive committee, and the executive
committee would do the rest; that is, they
would revise the present college rules and
have general charge of enforcing the new code.
Georgia made a little preliminary speech
about President Wallace’s faith in the girls
and in any experiment that they honestly
wanted to try. Then she read the committee
list: six prominent girls of the type who
could always be relied upon to do the sensible
thing, and Fluffy Dutton.</p>

<p>Fluffy jumped up to resign, but Straight
persuaded her to wait, and having waited,
Fluffy declared that no power on earth should
keep her from acting on Georgia’s old committee.
Before she knew it the committee
had elected her chairman.</p>

<p>“That’s only so I’ll come to all the meetings,”
grumbled Fluffy. “They’re so afraid
of not having a quorum.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’re fixing it about the note-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
table,” Montana Marie reminded her.
“Because if they’re all unwritten, I don’t see
why you can’t change one rule as well as
another, and I think that one is positively
unfair.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly, child,” Straight ordered
sharply. “Fluffy can’t be bothered with any
little fiddling custom like the note-room table
business. She’s fighting the ten o’clock rule.
She’s been using all her influence to get the
committee to report against it, and if she does,
and the girls can hereafter use their judgment
about going to bed, why, all the bother we’ve
had in organizing and starting the self-government
plan going will have been well worth
while, in my opinion.”</p>

<p>Fluffy sighed. “Maybe,” she said. “But
I think myself that looking out for your
rights is a terrible lot of bother. If you leave
it all to the faculty, they manage things fairly
well for you, and you have your time free for
fun.”</p>

<p>“But that’s not good sociology, Fluffy,”
Susanna Hart reminded her with malicious
sweetness. “If we’re going to learn to help
the working women, and to purify politics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
and so on, we must first understand how to
help ourselves and manage our own little
republic.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” muttered Fluffy, and went
off to a meeting of her hopelessly sensible
committee. They had devoted one session
each to the various college regulations, had
debated them “backward and forward and
crisscross,” as Fluffy had irritably confided
to Straight, and had ended each time by ratifying
the existing rule exactly as it stood.</p>

<p>“We don’t want to be too radical,” the most
sensible and the slowest of them all invariably
declaimed at each decision. “We don’t want
to antagonize any one by unnecessary upheavals.”</p>

<p>Fluffy had prodded them on, but she had
taken no special part in the debates. For if
they changed nothing else, she argued,
mustn’t they in sheer self-defense do away
with the ten o’clock rule? And to-day at last
the ten o’clock rule was reached. Naturally
Fluffy was worried and irritable. Besides,
she had quarreled with Georgia over the
make-up of the committee, and she suspected
that Georgia had intended the committee to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
let things alone—that she actually agreed
with them about upheavals and being too
radical. Fluffy had scorned to ask Georgia a
point-blank question about her attitude to the
ten o’clock rule.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the most hopelessly sensible
committee member, when Fluffy had called
the session to order, “I suppose the discussion
to-day will be more or less of a formality. I
don’t suppose any of us would consider changing
the most important and carefully considered
regulation that has been imposed on
our college life.”</p>

<p>“Is that the—the general sentiment?”
asked Fluffy desperately; and was met on all
sides by vigorous nods of approval. “Then,”
she went on hastily, “let’s adjourn at once,
before it’s too late to get a canoe or a tennis
court or something else amusing for the rest
of the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“There’s just one thing more,” objected the
highly sensible member. “I suppose it’s understood
that, under the self-government plan,
we’re in honor-bound to keep the rules we
make. We must provide for a discipline
committee to act in cases of carelessness or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
deliberate disregard, but I’m sure there’ll be
very little of that sort of thing now that the
girls can feel that they’re their own law-makers.
Isn’t it just splendid that we could
put the plan through this year?”</p>

<p>“Is all of that carried?” inquired Fluffy,
reckless of parliamentary procedure. “Well,
now we can adjourn.”</p>

<p>Of the various amusing things with which
one may fill a broken afternoon at Harding,
Fluffy chose the company of Montana Marie
O’Toole and the pursuit of chocolate soda.</p>

<p>“I take back some of what I said about
sociology,” she told Montana Marie over the
soda. “It’s interesting and up to date, but
it’s very misleading. It doesn’t tell anything
about the bother of protecting your rights.
Why, it’s even dangerous to try to protect
them! Here we are now, honor-bound to
keep their old rules—just so much worse off
than before. And all because I got excited
over the woman question, and Georgia has
such a practical mind and loves to try experiments.”</p>

<p>But Mary Brooks Hinsdale, having seen the
pair through the window and sacrificed her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
dignity to join them in the pursuit of soda,
refused to view the sociological episode as an
utter failure.</p>

<p>“Plenty of people would say to you: the
moral of that is to let well enough alone,”
said Mary. “But a much nicer moral, I
think, is: try again and you’ll come out
better. Besides, Fluffy, don’t you honestly
think that the good old Harding rules work
pretty well?”</p>

<p>Fluffy nodded dubiously. “The main
thing I’ve learned,” she explained, “is that
whatever is worth having in this world—like
the right to make your own rules—is a bother
to get and a bother to use. But I guess that’s
no reason for not going in for the worth-while
things.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have another soda all round,” suggested
Montana Marie.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>THE FRECKLES OF MISS A. PEASE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Harding College</span> had never gone in heavily
for track athletics. President Wallace discouraged
intercollegiate meets, and class
spirit in the matter seemed to be consumed
by basket-ball rivalries, with milder interest
in the spring term tennis matches. But the
affair of the popping mascots rankled in the
breasts of the sophomores. They resented the
trickery that had lost the Invincibles their
game, and they were bent on revenge, slow if
need be, but sure and crushing. Only opportunity
was lacking. Impulsive spirits had
suggested one or two plans, but the class
hung back cautiously.</p>

<p>“It must be a sure thing and as hard a hit
as they gave us, or it won’t do at all,” Susanna
Hart declared wisely.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this policy the sophomores
had waited until May blossoms scented the air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
and May languor threatened to dull the edge
of craft and strategy, leaving the freshmen in
complacent possession of their ill-gotten victory.
Finally the leading sophomores held a
long and agitated conference under a tree in
Paradise. But nobody had an idea that anybody
else considered at all feasible, and they
were about to adjourn in despair when Binks
Ames, who was late as usual, jumped a stone
wall to avoid a détour, and thereby gave Susanna
Hart an inspiration.</p>

<p>“There’s the track meet. We can beat
them all to pieces at that. We’ve got splendid
runners and jumpers, and they haven’t
any who are even passable. We can simply
whitewash them.”</p>

<p>“But who cares about a little old track
meet?”</p>

<p>“We can make them care,” declared Susanna.
“We can talk the subject up and raise
an excitement. We can make track meets
seem as important as basket-ball games. Well,
nearly as important,” amended Susanna compromisingly.</p>

<p>There was a discouraging lack of response,
but this only irritated Susanna into greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
enthusiasm. “Oh, please don’t be so fussy,”
she begged. “It’s our only chance—our very
last chance till next year, and paying them up
then won’t be the same thing at all. It’s silly
to say that people don’t care for track meets.
At other colleges they care a lot.”</p>

<p>“But it’s rather late to begin creating a
sentiment for them here,” objected a big girl
with a provoking drawl in her voice.</p>

<p>“Then we won’t begin,” retorted Susanna
pluckily. “We’ll pretend that the sentiment
is here already. We’ll be amazed—absolutely
struck dumb—to find that the freshmen don’t
understand about it. We will pretty nearly
go into hysterics when they say that they
haven’t yet made up their team. We might
suggest combining the meet and the tennis
tournament. I’ve often thought that would
be a good idea.”</p>

<p>Susanna’s determined enthusiasm finally
won the day. Anything was better than nothing,
and her scheme had no rivals. Accordingly
the bewildered freshmen found
themselves, an hour or so later, fairly immersed
in a strange tide of talk about a track
meet. Track meets appeared suddenly to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
the end and consummation of the Harding
year. Nothing else in spring term mattered.
The junior-senior meet was unimportant, like
the junior-senior basket-ball game; after you
stopped taking “required gym.” you naturally
lost interest and got out of form. But
the freshman-sophomore match was the event
of the spring term. Bewildering allusions to
broad and high jumps, to dashes, hurdle races,
and hammer throws, mingled with ready references
to the class champions, Binks and
Susanna being prominent among them. It
was a flood of sudden, unexpected, overwhelming
oratory. The freshmen, dazed and blinded,
retired to talk the matter over in private,
and the sophomores retired also, to wonder
whether they had opened fire too soon, and to
arrange a program and assign parts.</p>

<p>“And now for practice. We mustn’t take
chances. We must do so well that we can’t
help winning,” decreed Susanna inexorably.</p>

<p>Every afternoon, accordingly, the sophomores
who could run panted around the track
in the hot gymnasium, and those who could
jump were busy on the floor with bars and
“horses.” Every possible candidate was forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
to try out her powers. It was to be as complete
a “whitewash” of those tricky little
freshmen as infinite pains could achieve.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the freshmen consulted with the
gym. director, who was secretly amazed and
openly delighted at the sudden display of
interest in her department. Miss Andrews
picked a provisional team, superintended
strenuous practice hours, and mingled praise
and encouragement with tactful references to
the extra year’s training and rather exceptional
ability of the sophomores—“foemen
worthy of your steel, by whom it’s an honor
to be beaten.”</p>

<p>The freshmen managed to see enough of the
sophomores’ work to understand that their
case was indeed hopeless, but they were not at
all attracted by the honors of defeat. So they
practiced harder than ever and thereby lost
their best jumper, who sprained a knee in her
frantic efforts to outdo herself.</p>

<p>This was felt by the freshmen to be a crisis.
The jumper’s room was deluged with violets,
and the rest of the team all at once became
pampered darlings, for whom no attention
was too delicate or too flattering. Even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
basket-ball team had never been the center of
more anxious consideration.</p>

<p>“It would be a perfect shame to lose.” So
ran the popular clamor.</p>

<p>“The squad hasn’t any hope of winning.”</p>

<p>“We beat the Invincibles.”</p>

<p>“Let’s think up another plan.”</p>

<p>“Only it must be an entirely different
kind.”</p>

<p>“Well, ask Montana Marie. She fixed
things up before.”</p>

<p>So did public sentiment crystallize, and
Montana Marie found herself once more
waited upon by a deputation of leading
spirits.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want now?” she demanded
gaily. “A way to beat those horrid
sophs? But I never have ideas like that.
Ask Fluffy Dutton—oh, she’s on their side.
The other plan wasn’t my idea, was it? I just
had the general idea of rattling the Invincibles.
Couldn’t we rattle the squad? Oh,
you don’t want to repeat yourselves. Then I
should think you’d be willing to be beaten.
If you win, you repeat.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie lapsed into meditative silence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
watching the discussion as it wavered
to and fro among her guests. But at the first
pause she broke into speech again.</p>

<p>“Can’t you jump and run and so on?” she
demanded of a sleek, sweet-faced, pink-and-white
little girl named Amelia Pease.</p>

<p>Amelia shook her head, smiling gently.
“No, of course not. I can’t do anything in
gym. I guess you weren’t in my division.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie considered, frowning abstractedly.
“No, I wasn’t—oh, I know now!
It was a girl named Pease in Miss Mallon’s
Select School pour les Americaines. She
looked like you, too, only she had freckles
and you’re all peaches and cream.”</p>

<p>Amelia blushed at finding herself obliged
to own to a connection with Marie’s “gay
Paree.” “That’s my twin sister, I suppose.
She didn’t care for college, so mother sent her
abroad instead of keeping her on at prep.
school. She’s very athletic.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie laughed. “Her name is
Aurelia, isn’t it? I should say she is very
athletic. She used to get into awful scrapes
sliding down banisters and vaulting tennis
nets, and once she got caught turning hand-springs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
in the dormitory, with all our pillows
piled on the floor to soften it.”</p>

<p>Amelia smiled faintly. “Yes, she’s a dreadful
tomboy. She is a little stupider at books
than I am, but I’ve always envied her because
she was fine at something, instead of just poking
along the way I do. She’s just back from
Paris now, and she’s coming up to visit me
pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better scrub off her freckles
and let her jump for the freshmen,” suggested
Montana Marie with the casual air of a person
saying something trivial and rather foolish.</p>

<p>But the leading spirits, who had had not
the least doubt that Betty’s queer freshman
would somehow save the class again, exchanged
delighted glances, and then burst into
a flood of questions.</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Can’t people really tell you apart,
Amelia?”</p>

<p>“But what scrubs off freckles? I never
found anything that——”</p>

<p>“Would it be playing quite fair to use an
outsider?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’d own up afterward,” explained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
somebody, “when we’d laughed at them a lot
and got them properly sorry for the fuss they’re
making over track meets.”</p>

<p>“If we couldn’t get Aurelia’s freckles off,
we could paint some on Amelia,” suggested
somebody else.</p>

<p>“Nobody can tell us apart except by the
freckles,” Amelia assured them.</p>

<p>“Then of course we can do it,” cried everybody
at once.</p>

<p>Amelia was summarily ordered to send for
her twin, who was to arrive exactly two days
before the meet, spending the interval in
training for the jumps, and, if possible, in getting
rid of her freckles. Meanwhile the team
was to be taken into the secret, and Rita Carson,
who was wonderful about stage make-ups,
was to be instructed to try her hand at
freckles. Amelia reluctantly consented to be
freckled if necessary.</p>

<p>“Only she must use something that comes
off easily,” she stipulated. “If I can’t have
the fun that Aurelia does out of tearing around
in the sun, why, I don’t want my complexion
ruined—no, not even to win the track meet.”</p>

<p>With Amelia’s consent assured, Rita Carson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
was the incalculable element in the situation.
Rita was artistic, and she had the artistic temperament
strongly developed; which meant
that she would make freckles wonderfully or
not at all, that she could never be relied upon
to keep an engagement, and that she was more
likely than not to be missing on the crucial
day of the track meet. But as it was a case
of Rita or nobody, there was nothing to do but
try to keep her interested, and hope that possibly
the Paris sojourn had bleached out
Aurelia.</p>

<p>Aurelia’s letter soon settled that: “I’ll come
and do the jumps for you. All of my beauty
spots (and a few more) came back on shipboard.
I’d do quite a lot for you, but I draw
the line at puttering any more over my face.</p>

<p>“P. S. They’re mostly on my forehead—small
and millions of them.”</p>

<p>A week before the track meet Rita began
freckling Amelia according to her twin’s general
instruction. Various persons exclaimed
over the way Amelia’s lovely white skin was
getting sun-spotted. Amelia replied sweetly
that skin like hers generally freckled in summer.
To give color to this theory she spent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
her afternoons walking, canoeing, or driving
without a hat, which was good Harding custom,
but repugnant to poor Amelia. Another
bother was having to put on a hot gym. suit
in the middle of the afternoon and pretend to
practice with the team, to the list of which her
name had been added. Miss Andrews protested
vaguely, but as she had suddenly decided
to go abroad for the summer, she was too
busy getting ready to take much interest in
the freshman champions.</p>

<p>But the crowning horror of her situation
Amelia found in the restrictions put upon
face-washing.</p>

<p>“One wash a day.” Rita Carson was inexorable.
“It’s absurd of you to insist upon
being made up as often as that, and more I
simply won’t do.”</p>

<p>This seemed reasonable enough, but Amelia
tearfully declared that she never washed her
face less than four times daily. “And being
in the sun so much gets me hot, and the paint
feels sticky, and I’m just miserable,” she wailed
mournfully.</p>

<p>“You’re not game for things,” Rita told her
crossly. “You agreed to this plan, and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
can’t be any sicker of your bargain than I am.
When your twin comes you’ll only have to go
to classes. You can wash your face all the
afternoon and evening if you want to, pussy-cat.”</p>

<p>“I shall be off the campus then,” Amelia
retorted with dignity. “It’s been thought
simpler for us to room together up on Main
Street, so you’ll have a nice walk before breakfast
for a day or two.”</p>

<p>Aurelia’s arrival was of course kept in the
secret, while Amelia’s departure from the campus
was easily explained on the ground of her
wanting to be well rested for the meet. In
the morning Amelia, duly freckled, went to
classes, while Aurelia, too amused to protest,
was locked into their room in hiding. In the
afternoon Amelia hid, while Aurelia, escorted
and surrounded by a watchful band of the
initiated, went to practice. Her performances
delighted the escort so extravagantly that they
took her for a motor ride, showed her Paradise
from a canoe, and promised her wonderful
“eats” and “the time of her freckled life” as
soon as the meet was over and the secret out.
Meanwhile Amelia, who had “kept on” her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
freckles in order to make a necessary trip to
the library, waited in vain for a chance to go
out; and with the prospect of a total failure
before her she got up the next morning in an
extremely bad temper. Rita Carson was in a
bad temper too—she was not used to getting
up so early. To tease Amelia, she put the
twins in a row and matched freckle to freckle
with painstaking, maddening slowness. Then
she daubed two huge ones on Amelia’s nose,
for good measure, and departed, calling back
a final warning against water.</p>

<p>“But I could wash my nose without doing
any harm, couldn’t I, Aurelia?” asked Amelia
indignantly.</p>

<p>Aurelia burst into an annoying peal of
laughter. “I don’t know, I’m sure. Better
not take the risk. Oh, Amelia, you look perfectly
killing—so exactly like me. Come to
the glass and see.”</p>

<p>Amelia refused to be comforted. “I can
see those two freckles all the time,” she complained.
“They worry me to death. I’d like
to wash the whole thing off and—and——”</p>

<p>“Think what fun you’ll be having to-morrow,”
suggested Aurelia artfully. “And think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
how the class is depending on you. And above
everything, don’t cry.”</p>

<p>Amelia finally departed for the campus, her
freckles intact, her nerves unstrung, and a
wet wad of handkerchief “to use when she
just couldn’t stand it any longer” clutched
defiantly in her hot little hand.</p>

<p>But if it hadn’t been for Montana Marie all
might still have been well. Amelia “flunked
dead” in her first class, and she looked so wan
and woebegone over it that Montana Marie
thought it would be only decent to try to
cheer her up. She caught up with her between
College Hall and the Morton, and drew
her out of the crowd to congratulate her on
Aurelia’s perfectly splendid records. Just
then a big bottle-fly came buzzing along,
preceding Straight Dutton like a noisy herald.
Amelia struck out at it vigorously with her
wet handkerchief, and somehow in her excitement
hit her own nose instead of the fly.
Naturally, off came the two big freckles.</p>

<p>“Oh, stop!” cried Montana Marie, her eyes
wide with horror. “Stop! You’re losing
them!”</p>

<p>“Losing what?” demanded Straight, joining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
them. Being Straight, she would probably
have guessed at once, but Amelia saved her
the trouble by letting fall two big tears and
then dabbling wildly at the tears and the
freckles, which mingled in a sticky brownish
fluid on her peach-blossom cheeks.</p>

<p>Straight stared at the strange spectacle in
absolute mystification, and Montana Marie
boldly decided that the situation was not yet
desperate.</p>

<p>“I told you not to fuss with any of those
horrid face-washes,” she reproached the choking
Amelia. “Freckles aren’t the worst thing
in the world. You’ll be lucky if you haven’t
ruined your pretty complexion. As for the
freckles, I’ll bet they’re all back by afternoon,
don’t you, Straight?”</p>

<p>Straight watched them go with vague stirrings
of remorse, which dulled her suspicions.
Amelia Pease was rather a goose, but it was
mean to have gotten the freshmen so worked
up and nervous over the meet. Spring term
was meant for fun, not for strenuous, nerve-racking
contests that brought tears and
heart-burnings in their train.</p>

<p>But that afternoon it was a very trim, very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
alert, and perfectly self-possessed Miss A. Pease
who jumped nonchalantly over the records
and turned the sophomore audience pale with
rage and dismay. The other freshman athletes
did well too; even without Miss A.
Pease the meet was no sophomore walk-over,
and with her it was an overwhelming freshman
victory.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” complained Susanna Hart
irritably, “they needn’t act as if it was all so
comical. They needn’t have hysterics once in
about five minutes. They needn’t shriek
with mirth every time they look at me.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the joke connected with
the freckles of Miss A. Pease was being passed
along the freshman ranks, preparatory to its
being spread still further. The freshmen had
decided that, with Straight Dutton knowing
more than she ought, the safest as well as the
most dramatic procedure would be to let the
cat out of the bag the minute the final score
had been announced. Accordingly the freshman
president rose promptly, called for silence,
and with much dignity made her startling
statement.</p>

<p>“Owing to a possibly regrettable mistake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
we are obliged to withdraw the scores of Miss
A. Pease. That leaves the victory with the
sophomore team. We congratulate them
heartily, and”—with a sudden change of
tone—“here comes the mistake. Wouldn’t
you have made it too, if you could?”</p>

<p>This was a signal for Montana Marie to lead
the Pease twins into the center of the field—Amelia
again carefully freckled and dressed
exactly like her sister.</p>

<p>“Alike as two Pease in a pod,” cried some
would-be wit.</p>

<p>“Bully joke!” acknowledged a group of
generous sophomores.</p>

<p>“Too good to keep to ourselves,” shrilled
back Montana Marie.</p>

<p>“Who makes freckles? Rita Carson, she
makes freckles,” chanted a riotous freshman
chorus.</p>

<p>“Freckles that will come off,” added the
enlightened Straight.</p>

<p>In a minute the field was pandemonium,
with the Peases and Rita Carson being carried
round it on freshman shoulders, and the
sophomores clamoring eagerly for the whole
story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>“It’s not so bad,” admitted Susanna magnanimously.
“We’ve got you on muscle, but
I’m afraid you’ve got us on brains. So honors
are easy, and—oh, we’ve got another year
coming!” concluded Susanna with a joyous
little sigh.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>TWO SURPRISES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> last Bob Parker had got what she
wanted. Babe brought her up to Harding for
what they called “one last frisk,” in a big
motor-car, with a shiny hat trunk strapped
impressively on behind, and the most wonderful
tea-basket to take off on the numerous
picnics which were to be the “frisk’s” chief
feature, because Bob doted on them so.</p>

<p>“It’s a newsboys’ club to run just as I like,”
Bob explained around the festive board of
picnic number one. “It has a splendid
building in town, and a farm for summers
that I made father give me. How’s that for
little me?”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see how she’s ever going to
get away for any more fun,” Babe told them
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I shall have my fun as I go along, silly,”
Bob retorted promptly. “When you find a
job that really fits, you don’t need to worry
about vacations, do you, Betty Wales?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“Why don’t you ask me?” demanded
Madeline gaily. “I’m the one who’s really
perfectly crazy about her work.”</p>

<p>“I notice you take plenty of vacation,”
Babe told her.</p>

<p>“That,” said Madeline, “is because I’m
naturally idle and frivolous. Bob, being naturally
serious-minded and industrious, will do
differently, without sacrificing her happiness.”</p>

<p>“Calling one of the three little B’s industrious
and serious-minded!” mocked Babbie.
“How absurd! But it isn’t any absurder,
maybe, than the way the three little B’s
have settled down since they left college. Just
think! By next fall two of them will be staid
married ladies——”</p>

<p>“And the third will be wedded to a great
career,” Madeline took her up. “Of course
I’m always more interested in the great
careers. It’s dreadful to belong to such a
marrying bunch as this is. Any day I expect
to find myself alone in the state of single
blessedness.”</p>

<p>“You’re not worrying about that very much
yet a while, are you?” Rachel demanded
laughingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>“Not really losing sleep over it,” Madeline
acknowledged. “So far I feel that I can
safely count on you and Christy and Roberta,
and Bob—though for all I know there may
be a man behind her fondness for newsboys’
homes. I have my suspicions that there’s a
man behind Helen Adams’ sudden enthusiasm
for teaching, and I have my grave doubts
about Betty Wales. So far the two parties are
about even, but the O. M.’s are bound to lose
out in the end, poor dears!”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, we have enough weddings
to arrange for this summer,” sighed Babbie
Hildreth. “I certainly think we ought to
make out our schedule of dates right away
now, while we’re here together.”</p>

<p>“Do stop talking about that wedding
schedule, Babbie,” protested Babe. “It
sounds exactly like a matrimonial bureau.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the matter with matrimonial
bureaus?” Madeline came gaily to Babbie’s
rescue. “Aren’t we all disciples of Betty’s
congenial occupation theory? And isn’t
marriage a congenial occupation for more of
us than any other one pursuit? I think that
Betty ought to establish a matrimonial bureau-department<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
in her famous Congenial Employment
Agency.”</p>

<p>“I will,” laughed Betty, “if you’ll run it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let me run it,” begged Babe. “I
should love to make matches. Only I’m not
a bit businesslike. Father Morton says—— Good
gracious! That reminds me of something.”
Babe’s face was a study in dismay.
“Father Morton had dinner with us the day
I wired Bob about coming up for this ‘frisk.’
When he heard about it he said he’d come
too, but then he remembered he couldn’t, so
he sat down at my desk and wrote a letter to
Betty. Goodness, how he did rage about my
stub pens! He traced all the troubles of
modern civilization to stub pens.”</p>

<p>“And did he stop writing the letter because
the pens didn’t suit?” inquired Betty mildly.</p>

<p>Babe started. “I told you I wasn’t businesslike.
I go off so on tangents. Yes, he
finished the letter with John’s fountain pen—which
he also raged at—and gave it to me to
take to you. He said it was important. It’s
in my shopping bag this minute, just where I
put it when he gave it to me. We’d better go
right back and find it—we ought to, anyway,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
because it’s getting dark, and my man doesn’t
know the road. Wouldn’t Father Morton be
up in the air if he knew I’d forgotten his
important letter all this long time?”</p>

<p>A search of Babe’s shopping bag disclosed
no letter, important or otherwise. A general
shake-up of her luggage also failed to bring to
light the missing communication. Finally,
under protest, Babe opened the shiny hat
trunk, and there right on top was the letter,
fat and imposing in its long, official-looking
envelope.</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember now,” Babe confessed.
“I put it in there on purpose, so I’d be sure to
see it when I took out my best hat. As if
anybody ever wore best hats, or any hats,
in this lovely, comfortable spot! I’m very
sorry, Betty, though I always think it does
Father Morton good to be kept waiting.”</p>

<p>Betty laughed. “Then I shall put all the
blame on you,” she said, and took her letter
and Madeline off to the Tally-ho, where a big
dinner with features for the following night
made necessary a conference between the manager
and her chief furnisher of inspirations.</p>

<p>“May I just glance at this letter before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
we talk?” asked Betty. “You’ll excuse me,
won’t you, Mad? He probably wants me to
kidnap you and make you invent another
ploshkin, whether you want to or not.”</p>

<p>As Betty read, her expression grew serious,
then amazed, then almost frightened. “What
do you think now, Mad? He wants us to
come and start another barn tea-shop for him
round the corner from Fifth Avenue—oh,
Madeline, in almost the very place we wanted
when we started the Tally-ho—only of course
we never thought then of looking around for
a barn. And Madeline, what put it into his
head was a letter he had from a department
store in Chicago, wanting us to plan a tea-room
for them,—with features. Mr. Morton
thinks we’d better keep our ideas for our own
use.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” agreed Madeline, as calmly as
if opening a tea-shop off Fifth Avenue was an
every-day occurrence. “Tea-rooms aren’t like
ploshkins. If you make them too popular,
you spoil them. We can call the new place
the Coach and Four.”</p>

<p>“Then you think we can really start it?”
asked Betty anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>“Easily,” returned Madeline. “We can
manage the two places beautifully. You’ll
have to go down right away and get things
going. We can have our old Washington
Square cook, I’m almost sure. When I’m in
New York I’ll manage to be there a lot, and—we
shan’t open till fall, I should say, so
why not get Fluffy Dutton, who is planning
to waste her talents teaching the Young Idea,
to come and do the Proper Excitement act for
the Coach and Four?”</p>

<p>“And Georgia, who is also going to teach,
to do the hard, steady grind,” added Betty.</p>

<p>Madeline looked at her quizzically. “The
hard, steady grind that you’ve always had to
do for the Tally-ho,” she said repentantly.
“I’m sorry I’m such a flyaway, Betty.”</p>

<p>Betty laughed at Madeline’s woebegone expression.
“I’m not,” she said. “You’re a
genius, and I rather think Fluffy is one
too. I don’t mind the hard, steady pulling.
I rather like it—generally. But I can’t be
doing it in two places at once.”</p>

<p>Madeline nodded. “I know. There’s a lot
of hard, steady grind to every book I write—along
with a pinch or two, maybe, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
queer thing called genius. The grind in the
books I do myself, because I have to, and it’s
fun—the long, steady pull up to that lovely
stopping place called Finis. I say, Betty,
this old-maid business isn’t so bad. Just
think of all the fun we’ve had doing things,
and all the fun we’re going to have with the
Coach and Four. Those others give up a lot
for a mere man.”</p>

<p>Betty smiled indulgently at Madeline’s declaration
of independence. “If it hadn’t been
for a mere man named Morton, the Tally-ho
would have gone to smash long ago,” she reminded
her. “Mary Brooks hasn’t stopped
doing interesting things because she’s married,
and Babe could do anything she liked—have
half a dozen tea-shops, if she wanted them.
Mr. Morton would give them to her like that!
Only of course you’ve got to find the right
man.”</p>

<p>Madeline said nothing to that; she only
watched Betty’s face suddenly take on its
sober, far-away, grown-up look, and wondered
what that meant.</p>

<p>Presently Betty came out of her brown
study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>“‘Coach and Four might do for name.
Down Thursday with Miss Ayres to talk
things over and begin arrangements.’ Does
that sound like a businesslike telegram, Madeline?
And will you surely go on Thursday?
You must promise fair and square, because
Mr. Morton perfectly hates to be disappointed.
Well then, come with me to the telegraph
office.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t give much for Jim Watson’s
chances,” Madeline told Babe, who was sharing
her room, later the same evening. “She is
too happy as she is. I tell you, Babe, when a
girl has found her niche, and it’s as big as
Betty’s is and is going to be, it takes an extra-specially
wonderful man to carry her off her
feet.”</p>

<p>Babe sniffed. “It’s quite evident you’ve
never been in love, Madeline Ayres.”</p>

<p>“I’ve written some stunning love-scenes,”
Madeline retorted with a grin.</p>

<p>“If you think that’s the same thing, you
can just wait,” Babe told her loftily.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Madeline. “I shall have
to, I guess. Incidentally I know something
that will make you stare and be glad you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
know such distinguished and brilliant old
maids as Betty and me.”</p>

<p>“What?” demanded Babe, vastly excited.</p>

<p>“Can’t tell you yet a while.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because Betty said not to.”</p>

<p>Babe shrugged her shoulders with a fine
assumption of indifference. “It can’t be that
she’s engaged, after what you’ve said; so I
don’t care much about knowing.”</p>

<p>“Wait till you see it.”</p>

<p>Babe was too proud to ask any more questions,
but she lay awake for hours trying to
guess what It could be. Meanwhile Betty
Wales was dreaming wild dreams, at the
climax of which the dashing Coach and Four
ran over Jim Watson.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>MONTANA MARIE DISAPPEARS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton</span> answered Betty’s telegram
with another:</p>

<p>“Coach and Six not a bit too big for my
notions. Thursday O. K. for me. Young
Watson to plan improvements. Depend on
you to keep him docile.”</p>

<p>Madeline, being inspired by the evident
largeness of Mr. Morton’s notions, retired at
once to the Tally-ho loft to meditate on delightful
possibilities, and to sketch posters
and a hanging sign for the Coach and Six.
But presently her eye happened to fall upon
Thomas, the door-boy, and in a moment the
posters for the Coach and Six were forgotten,
and Madeline was off in hot pursuit of green
broadcloth.</p>

<p>“Take off your coat so I can use it for a
pattern,” she ordered the bewildered Thomas
on her return. “No, I suppose you can’t
do without a coat very well. Sprint home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
and get another suit that fits you. Tell your
mother I won’t hurt it. Hurry now.”</p>

<p>“The idea!” she told Betty while she
waited for Thomas. “We’ve had that boy
here for six months and never once thought
to dress him up in Lincoln green, like a post-boy.
Never mind! We need some new
features for commencement. We can’t have
19— think we’re just resting on our laurels.
I’ll make new tea menus to match Thomas—little
riding-crops painted across the top, with
real green ribbon rosettes stuck on the handles.
Or why not have real little riding-crops?
Thomas can whittle them out in his idle
moments.”</p>

<p>In vain Betty suggested that the Tally-ho
was well enough as it was, and that the plans
for the Coach and Six must be well advanced
by Thursday or Mr. Morton would be
impatient and annoyed. Madeline calmly
branched out on to fairy menus for the Peter
Pan annex, and then became completely
absorbed in a fairy play suggested to her by
the menus. She was persuaded to keep the
Thursday appointment in New York only
because she wanted to read the play to Agatha<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
Dwight. Betty, who had been busy all the
week with plans and estimates, memoranda of
“things we ought to have,” “things to speak
to Jim about,” “necessary glass and silver,”
and so on, was duly grateful that Madeline
consented to accompany her on any pretext;
for when Madeline was once on the ground,
with the actual site of the Coach and Six,
Jim’s ideas, and Mr. Morton’s fury of energy
to inspire her, Betty knew she would forget
even the fairy play and plan a tea-shop that
would dazzle “little old New York.”</p>

<p>And she did. Jasper J. Morton followed
her delightedly about all day, his eyes twinkling
and his dry laugh cackling out at her
queer, unsystematic methods of work. He
went with her to choose furniture, to interview
the famous Mr. Enderby, who, quite overcome
by the awe-inspiring combination of the irresistible
Madeline Ayres and the great Mr.
Morton, promised to design anything from
walls to menus; and finally they rode off
together to engage the Washington Square
cook, who blandly ignored the great Mr.
Morton, but promised to come and cook in his
tea-shop any time “if you axes me, Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
Madeline, an’ bring a black kitten as usual, if
so desired.”</p>

<p>By the time he had watched Madeline
order livery for the porters, design costumes
for the maids, pick out china, and overturn
all Jim’s plans because the fireplace wasn’t
quite big enough to please her, Mr. Morton
turned to Betty with a sigh of admiration.</p>

<p>“She’s a steam-engine, that girl. She could
tire me out, I guess. See here, I guess she
keeps you fairly busy, picking up after her,
like. She’s the beginning kind—don’t wait
to put on any finishing touches. All right.
We’ll hire two or three finishers to go round
after her. She’d make several fortunes for
anybody that could manage her right. See
here, Miss Ayres, couldn’t you wind up the
day by inventing another of those splasher
novelties?”</p>

<p>Madeline shook her head laughingly. “I’m
going to dinner now with Agatha Dwight. I
want to read her a play I’ve just written.”</p>

<p>So Mr. Morton bore off Betty and Jim for
dinner with him. During the dessert he discovered
an opportune acquaintance at the
next table, who kept him talking so long that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
Betty had to interrupt them to say good-bye,
and Jim had to take Betty to her train. She
had wanted to stay over a day for spring
shopping, but there was a Student’s Aid trustee-meeting
the next morning, and the secretary
must be on hand to report.</p>

<p>It was nearly half-past ten when Betty
drove up to the campus. She dismissed her
carriage at the little gate close to Morton Hall,
which, to her amazement, was still ablaze with
lights. In a minute she remembered why; it
was the evening of the Belden-Morton play.
Betty hurried up the walk, anxious to hear
how it had gone off. She thought the door
might still be open, and she tried it before she
went down to the end of the piazza to tap, as
she had arranged to do, on Mrs. Post’s sitting-room
window. There was a light in the room,
but the shade was up, and between the hanging
curtains Betty could see that the room was
empty, and the bedroom beyond dark. Evidently
Mrs. Post was talking over the play
with her girls, utterly forgetful of her promise
to let Betty in. So Betty went back to the
door and rang, and, as it was rather a shivery
spring night, she tramped down the piazza<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
again while she waited for somebody to come
and open the door. As she turned the corner
she heard voices, and saw a man leading two
saddle-horses and a girl in a black dress and
white cap and apron—evidently one of the
Morton Hall maids—come up a path that led
through the shrubberies between Morton Hall
and the Students’ Building, where the play
had been given.</p>

<p>“I think we should try it over,” the man
was saying as they stopped in a patch of light
by the back door.</p>

<p>“No indeed! How absurd you are, dear,”
tittered the girl. “The idea of rehearsing a
thing like——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Wales! Come right in out of the
cold, you poor child.” Mrs. Post’s kindly voice
broke into the tête-à-tête by the back door.
“I’m so sorry I forgot you. Come and have
some supper and hear about the wonderful
play. I’m giving the girls a little treat to make
them sleep better after all the excitement.”</p>

<p>The Belden-Morton production of “The
Purple Ribbon” had been a grand success.
Georgia Ames, Fluffy Dutton, and the Mystery
had collaborated in writing it, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
program announced that it was a subtle combination
of Shaw, Shakespeare, and Sherlock
Holmes. The Morton Hall half of the cast,
still in make-up and costumes, lined up for
Betty’s appreciative inspection. The Thorn
was the villain of the piece, in very elegant
evening clothes and curling black moustaches.
The twin Digs figured respectively as the villain’s
innocent young accomplice (white flannels
and very pink cheeks), and the heroine’s
mother-in-law (Mrs. Post’s second best black
silk, a bonnet with strings, and white mitts).
The Mystery had fairly insisted that the
freckle-faced girl who roomed next to her
should have a part, “because she wants it so
awfully much.” So she had been cast for the
Enigma, who had nothing particular to do
but wear a blank and unintelligent expression
and say, “Is it so?” at intervals. This
she had done so effectively that she had made
the hit of the evening. Mrs. Post and the
none-acting members of Morton Hall explained
all this eagerly to Betty, and then
Connie was called into the line because she
had been the Bell and the Noise Without.</p>

<p>“And I was the only one of the cast that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
had to be prompted,” Connie confessed sadly.
“I was thinking how awfully pretty my roommate
looked in black, and if Georgia hadn’t
poked me hard——”</p>

<p>“Why, where’s Amanda O’Toole?” cut in
the Thorn suddenly. “She was Amanda
the maid, Miss Wales, and she did look too
cute—— Oh, there you are, Marie. Come
and let Miss Wales see how you look in the
raiment of servitude.”</p>

<p>Marie had borrowed her costume complete
from the obliging Belden House Annie, adding
nothing but a dashing moline bow under
her chin.</p>

<p>“Ain’t she the prettiest Amanda that ever
came down the pike?” quoted the Thorn from
her part, with a genial twirl of her huge
moustaches.</p>

<p>“I sure am, but it’s no concern of yours,
Monsieur,” retorted Marie, from her part,
flirting her black skirt coquettishly as she
made for a plate of sandwiches. “Isn’t Mrs.
Post the nice lady? I’m as hungry as a bear—I
couldn’t eat any dinner because I was so excited
about the play.”</p>

<p>“If you were so hungry, why didn’t you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
come in here sooner?” demanded the Thorn
incisively. “The rest of us are all through
eating.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was fussing around. This is the
first time I was ever on the stage, you see, and
I’m that rattled.” Montana Marie took a
huge bite out of one of Mrs. Post’s ginger-cookies
by way of closing the discussion.</p>

<p>Betty went to bed humming a gay little
tune. She was thinking of the house-play
that Roberta Lewis had starred in so splendidly
years ago, of the Coach and Six, of the
Student’s Aid meeting in the morning,—she
must get up early to write her report,—and
finally of Jim Watson’s comical struggle between
strong personal annoyance at her having
added another to her too-numerous interests
and responsibilities and his equally strong
artistic approval of Madeline’s ideas for the
Coach and Six and of Mr. Morton’s lavishness
in carrying them out.</p>

<p>“I smell lilacs!” Betty decided suddenly,
and turning off her lights she leaned far out
into the dark, eagerly drinking in the sweet
spring odors. And then, as her eyes fell on
the patch of light by the back door, she remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
the anxious groom and the tittering
maid, whom she had heard arguing by the
back porch, and she wondered idly what kind
of thing it was you didn’t rehearse, in the
opinion of said tittering maid. Probably she
had been telling the groom all about the play,
and they were discussing some point in the
plot. The maids were always as keen as the
girls about the house-plays. Then she wondered,
thinking of the two saddle-horses, if the
Moonshiners’ riding club had been revived,
and she decided to ask Georgia if she might
go off on some of their spring trips. Harding
was so lovely in the spring—no other place
was quite like it. But—those Student’s Aid
trustees met at ten o’clock sharp. Betty resolutely
dismissed plays and picnics and the
disturbing scent of lilacs from her mind, and
courted sleep; for her alarm clock was set for
six and she must be ready for a hard morning’s
work.</p>

<p>It was an exciting day, altogether. One of
the Student’s Aid trustees had secured a big
gift for the Association. In return she wanted
to dictate important policies, and particularly
to lay out the secretary’s work. The other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
trustees resented her assumption of superior
authority. Both factions took Betty into
their confidence. One insisted on giving her
lunch; the other asked her to dinner. Mr.
Morton telegraphed for impossible details.
Mrs. Post had hit upon this busiest day of the
year for cleaning Betty’s room. Feeling very
young and inadequate, and very, very sleepy,
Betty escaped as soon as possible from the
trustees’ dinner, put a “Do not disturb” sign
on her door and went to bed.</p>

<p>The pale morning sun was creeping faintly
in at her window, though she was sure she
hadn’t been asleep ten minutes, when somebody
knocked on her door. Somebody had
to keep on knocking for an embarrassing interval
before Betty woke up enough to realize
what was happening, and to open the door.
Connie stood outside. She was attired in a
scarlet silk kimono, the gift of her generous
but thoughtless roommate. For Connie’s
washed-out hair had a decided suspicion of
red in its dull tints, and her complexion
was the sort that went with red hair and
should never go with a scarlet kimono. In
the dim light of the corridor her sallow, anxious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
little face looked frightened and quite
ghostly.</p>

<p>“Did I wake you up, Miss Wales?” she
demanded stupidly. “It’s four o’clock in the
morning. I saw your ‘Don’t disturb’ sign,
but I suppose it was meant for last night.
Besides I—you see, Miss Wales, Marie has disappeared.”</p>

<p>Betty stifled a tremendous yawn and tried
to consider Connie’s news with becoming
seriousness.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t understand,” she said at
last. “You mean she isn’t in your room?
Are you sure she isn’t in some one’s
else?”</p>

<p>Connie nodded. “Yes—she—I’m quite sure,
Miss Wales. She’s disappeared.”</p>

<p>“When?” asked Betty, who was wide awake
now.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Miss Wales. About ten was
when I really saw her last. She had a chafing-dish
party last night. I was studying with
Matilda Jones. I kept expecting Marie to
come for me, as she usually does just before
they disperse, to have some of the refreshments.
When the ten-minute bell rang, I went to our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
room. She was there, but she went right out
for something. When she came back it was
after ten, so she undressed in the dark. At
least I supposed she undressed. When I woke
up just now she was gone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Betty pleasantly, “she’s
somewhere in the house, of course. She
ought to be in her room in bed, but——”</p>

<p>“Her saddle and that big felt hat she wears
when she rides, and her corduroy suit have
disappeared too, Miss Wales.”</p>

<p>Betty started. “They have? Then she’s
probably gone on some early-morning riding-party.
Oh, dear, those crazy girls! What
won’t they think of next?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it’s a regular riding-party,
Miss Wales. From things Marie has been
saying lately, I think it’s an elopement.”</p>

<p>Betty’s eyes grew round, and her voice
quivered with anxiety. “Please tell me all
that you know about it, Miss Payson, as
quickly as you can. There may be no time
to lose.” Betty closed the door softly and
began hurriedly to put on her clothes, while
she listened to Connie’s story.</p>

<p>“Well,” began Connie eagerly, “she’s been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
writing letters lately—oh, quantities of them!
She always writes a good many, but lately
she’s spent most of her time at it. And she’s
cut classes a good deal. She’s never done that
before. And a few days ago she gave me six
of her dresses—two perfectly new ones. She
said she shouldn’t want so many clothes
much longer. Then day before yesterday a
man came to call. I heard the girls say it
was the same one she was with the night of
the prom. She was very much excited that
evening, and it wasn’t about the play, because
when I spoke about that to her she didn’t
know what I meant at first, and then she
said, ‘Oh, the play!’ as if it wasn’t of any
consequence to her. Yesterday morning
when I came into our room after a class she
was rolling a lot of things up in her rain-coat.
I asked her what in the world she was doing,
and she—she kissed me”—Connie blushed at
the intimate confession—“and said she was
just seeing how much you could tie on to a
saddle, because some one had asked her to find
out. And now”—Connie’s lips and voice
quivered—“and now she’s gone. That’s all I
know, Miss Wales. I think she’s eloped on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
horseback with that man from her home in
Montana.”</p>

<p>“But that would be so perfectly absurd!”
Betty was dressed by this time. She twisted
her hair into a hasty knot, and put on a
droopy hat to hide the snarls. “Have you
ever heard Marie speak of riding to any of the
little towns around here, Miss Payson? Was
she especially fond of any little village near
here?”</p>

<p>Connie considered for a minute. “She
likes the ride to Gay’s Mills, because it’s all
the way through the woods. And she’s been
over there twice lately. She went riding day
before yesterday,—we all thought it was queer
for her to go riding on the day of the play—and
I think from something she said that she
lost the girl she started out with, and maybe
met some one else.”</p>

<p>“What girl did she start with?”</p>

<p>Connie mentioned the name of the sophomore
who, being proverbially unlucky with
horses, had fallen off on the famous Mountain
Day ride.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Betty curtly. She was perfectly
sure that, unless Montana Marie had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
meant to lose her, she would never have gone
riding with that particular girl. “Please
telephone Grant’s garage,” Betty ordered
swiftly. “Tell them to send up a car at once,
and a man who knows the country roads.
Say it’s for me. If they object to the early
start tell them it’s a matter of vital importance.
If that’s not enough, hold the wire
and call me. I shall be in Mrs. Post’s room.
I hate to bother her, but I can’t very well go
alone.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you take me?” asked Connie
eagerly.</p>

<p>Betty considered. “Why—yes—yes, that
might be quite as well. Then you go and get
ready, while I do the telephoning.”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Connie and Betty
were flying along the road to Gay’s Mills. It
was a slender chance, but in the absence of
other clues it must serve. Connie confided to
Betty that she had never been in an automobile
before.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter,” Betty told her absently.
“Oh, I beg your pardon. I don’t
believe I quite understood what you said.”</p>

<p>Connie lapsed into rather frightened silence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
and Betty was left free to consider the situation.
“Undertaking” Montana Marie O’Toole
looked, this morning, like a pretty serious
business. If she really had eloped, what
would Mrs. O’Toole say? And what would
President Wallace think? Not much use getting
her through mid-years for an ending like
this. But somehow Betty couldn’t believe
that her freshman would be so foolish. She
almost ordered the chauffeur to drive back to
the campus; she was sure they would find that
Georgia was missing too, and the other riding
people. Then suddenly she remembered the
maid and the groom, as she had thought them,
talking by the Morton House door, and Montana
Marie’s belated arrival at Mrs. Post’s
treat. Was an elopement perhaps the kind of
thing that you didn’t rehearse? Betty’s heart
sank. Perhaps she ought to have called Mrs.
Post and divided responsibilities. Perhaps
she ought even to have aroused Prexy. Certainly
she ought to have had a better reason
than Connie’s vague surmises for choosing the
Gay’s Mills road. The Gay’s Mills road
turned sharply just then, and Betty saw two
horseback riders trotting decorously to meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
her—Montana Marie in her Western riding
things, including the forbidden magenta handkerchief,
and a man whom Connie identified
briefly with an excited ungrammatical little
squeak.</p>

<p>“It’s him!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>LIVING UP TO HARDING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sh!</span>” Betty warned her hastily, because
of the chauffeur, and leaning forward she
ordered him to stop. “I want to speak to
those people,” she explained briefly.</p>

<p>Just then Montana Marie, who had the sun
in her eyes, recognized Betty, and triumphantly
announced the discovery to her companion
in her shrillest tones. “It’s Miss
Wales come after us. What did I tell you?”</p>

<p>Then she slipped off her horse, and with
the reins thrown over her arm came to meet
Betty, while the man from Montana, looking
very glum and very foolish, prepared to stay
where he was.</p>

<p>But, “Come on, Fred, and meet Miss
Wales,” Montana Marie commanded imperiously,
and he dismounted in turn and followed
Marie.</p>

<p>“You needn’t have come after us,” Marie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
began smilingly. “We were just going back
of ourselves. I happened to think that you
wouldn’t like it.”</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t——” began Betty
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Haven’t eloped?” finished Marie easily.
“Oh, no, not yet. We weren’t half-way to
Gay’s Mills when I happened to think how
you’d feel. And ever since we’ve been
standing in the road, up there at the top of
the hill, arguing about it, haven’t we, Fred?”</p>

<p>The boy—he looked younger than Marie—nodded
sullenly. “Not arguing exactly,” he
amended. “You just kept saying over and
over that you wouldn’t go on.”</p>

<p>“Until I’d seen Miss Wales,” amended Marie
calmly. Then she looked at the car, and, apparently
noticing Connie for the first time,
called out cheerfully, “Hello, roomie! Too
bad I waked you out of your early-morning
nap with that squeaky door.”</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” Connie quavered back in
a frightened voice.</p>

<p>“We ought to get rid of her and of
that chauffeur,” declared Marie competently.
“Why not all go home now, and then I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
come to see you this morning, Miss Wales,
whenever you say.”</p>

<p>This was such an amazing proposition from
the chief eloper, that Betty stared at it for a
moment.</p>

<p>“You can trust us to follow right along,
Miss Wales,” said the man from Montana
quietly. “Or better still, Marie can go back
with you, and I’ll lead her horse home. I
guess that’s the best way, Marie.”</p>

<p>Betty took a sudden liking to the man
from Montana. There was something very
straightforward and businesslike about him,
and his sulks were only natural under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Marie, having considered
the proposal for a moment. “Only give me
my saddle-pack. It might jog loose without
your noticing, and it has my silver toilette
things in it, and all my pictures of you, Fred.”</p>

<p>So Montana Marie O’Toole, bearing the
precious possessions which, for reasons known
only to herself, she had chosen to bring with
her on her elopement, placidly took her seat
in the tonneau, between Connie and Betty;
and all the way home she chatted composedly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
instructing Connie in the lore of automobiling—quite
as if an early-morning elopement
(that did not come off) was a part of her daily
routine.</p>

<p>“Don’t you tell anybody about Fred and
me,” she ordered Connie, when they were
back at the Morton. “And say, take my
rain-coat and empty it out, before the girls get
a chance to see it and wonder what it means.
I’m going to talk to Miss Wales.”</p>

<p>But once alone with Betty, she broke down
and cried, dabbling at the tears with her
magenta handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Maybe you think I don’t want to marry
Fred,” she wailed. “Maybe you think I didn’t
get Ma interested in American colleges on purpose
so Fred and I could be nearer together.
It takes two weeks for letters from the Bar 4
ranch to get to Paris. Think of the things that
can happen on a ranch in two weeks. From
Bar 4 to Harding is only four days. Of course
a college in Montana would have been still
better, but Ma would have seen through that.
Oh, dear, what shall I do, Miss Wales?”</p>

<p>“Send your friend about his business, go
home in June, tell your mother about your engagement,—if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
you are engaged,—and have a
pretty wedding in your own home, when you
and your family decide that it is best for you
to be married.” Betty was trying hard to act
the part of sensible, middle-aged adviser to
heedless youth, though she felt extremely unequal
to the rôle.</p>

<p>“That sounds lovely,” wailed Montana
Marie, “but the trouble is, you don’t know
Ma.”</p>

<p>“I know she’s very fond of you,” began
Betty.</p>

<p>“But she’s a lot fonder of a ridiculous idea
she’s got into her head of having me marry a
duke, or a prince, or some other horrid little
foreigner. That’s what she’s designed me for,
ever since I was born and Pa struck it rich on
the same day. She’s always thought it was a
sort of providence. And my being in love
with Fred doesn’t make the least particle of
difference to her.” Marie sobbed again forlornly.
“I ’most wish we had gone right on
and got married this morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you don’t,” Betty assured her
earnestly. “Think how ashamed I should
have felt, and how all the college would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
been talked about and laughed at on your account.”</p>

<p>Marie brightened visibly. “I thought of
that myself. That’s exactly why I wouldn’t
go on. Out in Montana lots of girls just ride
off and get married on the spur of the minute.
But it’s different here, isn’t it? I felt that it
was, after we’d started. And it’s different
with me. After you’ve been to school in
Paris, and to college for nearly a year, and
have traveled a lot, you can’t do the way you
could if you’ve lived your whole life in a mining
camp. I thought when I put on my
Western togs that I’d get into the spirit of the
occasion, but I didn’t. I felt silly.”</p>

<p>“Was it your idea?” asked Betty curiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” acknowledged Montana Marie,
“it was every bit my idea. Don’t you blame
it on Fred. His only reason for coming East
was to make sure that nobody had cut him out.
You see he didn’t understand about the businesslike
nature of the Prom. Man Supply Company.
Miss Wales——”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose you could possibly persuade
Ma to let us be married?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>“If you’ll send Fred home and finish your
year’s work here properly, I’ll try.”</p>

<p>Montana Marie considered. “All right. I
can promise that much without any trouble.
I told Fred that I’d rather elope out West than
here, if we had to do it at all. Ma wants to
take me to Europe again for the summer, but I
shall just put my foot down that I’ve got to see
my father first. Then if you haven’t persuaded
her by that time—— Oh, Miss Wales——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” encouraged Betty smilingly.</p>

<p>“If Georgia Ames sent Ma an invitation to
commencement, I think she’d come. That
would give you a chance to talk to her, and
talking is better than writing any day.”</p>

<p>Betty agreed that it was.</p>

<p>“And you must talk to Fred before he goes,
so you can see what a nice boy he is. Ma
ought to see that what we need in our family
isn’t a silly title nor more money, but brains
and good sense and nice manners. Fred has
all those.”</p>

<p>Betty promised to talk to Fred later in the
morning, and Marie prepared to depart. After
she had opened the door she came back to ask
a final question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>“Miss Wales, when you promised to undertake
me last summer, you didn’t guess why I
wanted to come to Harding College so badly,
now did you?”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” said Betty. “I thought you
were coming for what you could get out of it,—the
fun and the experience and the education.”</p>

<p>“Whereas,” Marie took her up, “I was
coming to be nearer to Fred, and to have a
chance to marry him. But I did get the fun
and the experience and the education too.
So you haven’t wasted your time, Miss
Wales.” Montana Marie held up her flower-like
face for a kiss.</p>

<p>Up in her own room Montana Marie
changed into a linen dress, discoursing meanwhile
to Connie on the merits of a college
education. “Concentration is all right.
That is going to come in handy whatever
we do later. But the best thing about a
college education is the way you have to live
up to it. So many people are nice to you and
help you along. You can’t make them sorry
they did it. All my life people are going to
find out that I was at Harding for a year—well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
at least a year,” put in Marie hastily.
“And after the royal way I’ve been treated
here, I’ve got to live up to Harding. I wish
I’d thought of that sooner, but I was certainly
lucky to think of it when I did.”</p>

<p>Later she expatiated upon the same thesis
to Betty and the man from Montana, whom
she had conducted to Betty’s office for the
promised interview.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said the boy with a whimsical
smile, “maybe I’m not up to Harding standards,
Marie. This year at college has
changed you—I can see that. Maybe I’m
not——”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” cut in Marie, and slammed
the door after herself. The next minute she
stuck her head in to say, “If you’re not up
to them, you’ll have to improve, that’s all.
Because you and I——” she backed out and
shut the door—softly this time.</p>

<p>That night Straight Dutton trilled outside
Betty’s window. “Come out for a speck of a
stroll,” she begged. “It’s lovely lilac-scented
moonlight out here, and I’ve got a jist to tell
you. It’s about your freshman.”</p>

<p>Wondering anxiously if Montana Marie’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
attempt at an elopement could have been
discovered, Betty hurried out to meet Straight.</p>

<p>“I’ve discovered why she came to Harding,”
Straight began with gratifying promptness.
“And it’s just as queer and ridiculous
as you’d expect her reason for doing a good
sensible thing to be.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” queried Betty, her heart sinking
lower with Straight’s every word. If Straight
knew, all the college knew. Even if the
newspapers didn’t get hold of it, it was bad
enough; and if they did——</p>

<p>“How did you find out, Straight?” she
asked desperately.</p>

<p>“She told me.” Straight was too much
amused by the absurdity of the reason to
notice Betty’s perturbation. “She didn’t
mean to tell, but I got it out of her.”</p>

<p>Betty met this disclosure in annoyed silence.</p>

<p>“Want to guess?” asked Straight gaily.
“But you never could. She came to learn
American slang, so she can fascinate the
French nobility with it. She says they all
adore American slang. She says I have
taught her more than any other one person,
and so when she’s married to a count or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
duke or an earl—what’s a French earl, Betty?—she’s
going to ask me to the wedding to
show her undying gratitude. Isn’t that
absurd? And yet she means every word of
it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Straight, dear!” Betty laughed at
her merrily. “What perfect nonsense! Even
Montana Marie isn’t so absurd as that. She
was paying you up for the weird tales of
Harding customs that you told her last fall.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think so,” said Straight positively.
“She’s forgotten all about those
weird tales. Well, if this isn’t her real reason,
I’ll bet the real one is just as comical. Montana
Marie O’Toole never struggled into Harding
College just to learn a little Latin and less
Greek.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” agreed Betty solemnly.
“Very likely you’re right, Straight.”</p>

<p>“When I flap my invitation to the duke’s
wedding in your face,” declared Straight
solemnly, “then you’ll see that I am. Fluff
and Georgia and Timmy and I are compiling
her a dictionary of slang for our parting
present.”</p>

<p>“Be sure you dedicate it ‘To the Champion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
Bluffer,’” advised Betty, her eyes dancing at
the thought of Straight’s probably speedy
disillusion. “And now I must really go in,
Straight. I have dozens of things to do.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” Straight begged, desperate
in her turn. “Betty Wales, twins are twins.
If Georgia and Fluff are going to be in a
wonderful new tea-shop in New York, what’s
to become of me? Can’t there be a place for
me too? Fluffy won’t do anything unless I’m
there to keep her cheerful and help her decide
things. Can’t there be a place for me too? I
know I’m not clever like Fluffy, nor pretty.
My—hair—doesn’t—curl. But twins are
twins, Betty Wales.”</p>

<p>Betty patted her shoulder comfortingly.
“I’ll think. If Emily Davis goes back to
teaching, perhaps Georgia could be here, and
you and Fluff—or you two could be here.
Well, I’ll think, Straight. I ought to have
thought sooner. I wish I had a twin to keep
me cheerful and help me decide things. I
need one this minute worse than Fluffy ever
did in her life. Now I must go.”</p>

<p>Straight stared after her wonderingly.
“She needs a twin! Good gracious! If she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
was twins, I guess there isn’t anything in the
world she couldn’t do. And yet for all she’s
such a winner, she knows what it means to be
just a plain straight-haired twin like me.
She’ll manage about fixing a place for me.
And she shan’t ever be sorry she did. Now I
can go to the last meeting of the Why-Get-Up-to-Breakfast
Club and be the life of the party.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Betty Wales, quite appalled by
the day’s complications, was getting them off
her mind by writing to Jim. “Here are a few
of the things I have on hand just now,” she
wrote. “Stopping elopements, deciding on
the eligibility of strange suitors, persuading
eccentric mothers to let their daughters marry,
fitting two twins into the position that one
twin will fill. So of course I can’t come to
New York again until after commencement,
and you must persuade Mr. Morton that it
doesn’t matter a bit. Which is as nice a job
as most of mine.”</p>

</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Ma’s</span> coming, all right!” Montana Marie
told Betty gleefully, a week or so after the
elopement that didn’t come off. “I told her
it might be her last chance at a Harding commencement,
and she thinks that means that I’m
to be in gay Paree with her again next winter,
so she’s in a very good humor. I hope it’s
ripping hot weather for commencement. Hot
weather wilts Ma right down, and makes her
easier to manage.”</p>

<p>A few days later Marie had another announcement
to make. “Pa is coming East
too. Georgia addressed her invitation to Mr.
and Mrs. James J., just out of politeness.
Now she is wild on the question of tickets for
things. If Pa really comes here, her sister
Constance will have to go on standing room
to the senior play and the Ivy concert. For
my part I’m crazy to see Pa, but I don’t
imagine he’ll care much about these commencement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
doings. His real reason for coming
East is to hire an architect in New York—I
don’t know what he’s going to build, but
I wrote right back and told him about your
friend Mr. Watson.” Marie giggled amiably.
“That address that Mrs. Hinsdale gave me
is forever coming in handy.”</p>

<p>Betty wished, quite unreasonably, that
Marie’s memory for addresses was shorter, or
her interest in Jim’s career less personal.
Whatever Mr. O’Toole meant to build, it
would probably be built in Montana; and
Montana is a very, very long way from Harding.
It was much nicer having Jim in New
York.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Betty was far too busy to spend
much thought on the O’Toole family’s affairs;
when Mrs. O’Toole actually appeared on the
scene, it would be time enough for bothering
with her. 19—’s third year reunion was
equally imminent and much more interesting.
Of course the members who lived in Harding
were depended upon to attend to all such details
as boarding places and class supper, to
plan for informal “stunt-meetings,” and to
arrange a reunion costume that should go far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
ahead of that worn by any other returning
class. Besides all this, the B. C. A.’s had decided
to give a party for 19—. Madeline had
glibly agreed to plan it, and had got as far as
confiding to all her friends that this time
she had really thought of something extra-specially
lovely, when the Coach and Six
took her to New York, and Agatha Dwight’s
interest in the fairy play kept her there. At
first the B. C. A.’s waited hopefully for her
return. Then they held a solemn conclave to
discuss their dilemma. But the only plans
they could evolve seemed so prosaically commonplace
beside Madeline’s most casual inspirations
that they continued to wait, this
time with the calmness born of despair. For
the B. C. A. invitations had been sent out
broadcast to all 19—ers, and though 19—
could have an absurdly good time over “just
any old thing,” it wasn’t “just any old thing”
that they would expect of the B. C. A.’s.
Finally Betty wrote to Roberta Lewis, who
would be passing through New York on her
way up to Harding. “Capture Madeline,”
she ordered summarily. “Bring her up here
if you can, but anyway make her tell you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
about the B. C. A. party. Don’t come away
without her plans for it, on penalty of being
put out of the Merry Hearts—almost.”</p>

<p>Luckily for Roberta, Madeline was easily
captured. She was sulking in solitary state
in her studio apartment, because, though
Agatha Dwight liked the fairy play tremendously,
no manager could be found to put it on.</p>

<p>“They say, ‘Stick to your old line,’” grumbled
Madeline. “As if the one play I’ve
written—about a modern woman—was a line.
They say, ‘New York doesn’t care for fairies.’
As if every sensible person wasn’t born caring
for fairies—the really-truly mystic sprites like
mine. Oh, I suppose the thing’s not good
enough! Anyway I won’t grumble about it
any more. I’ll plan a B. C. A. party that will
make dear old 19— laugh itself sick. Not a
fairy party—a—a germ party, Roberta. You
shall be the Ph. D. Germ—in an Oxford gown
with a stunning scarlet hood. I shouldn’t
wonder if Miss Ferris will lend you hers.
Then there’ll be the Love Germ, and the Wedding
Bells Germ, the Club Germ, the Society
Germ, and the Germ of a Career. And little
Betty Wales shall be the college girl that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
all viciously attack. It shall be a play with
a moral,—one of nice old Mary’s nice little
morals. And the moral shall be: ‘It isn’t
the Germ you like that gets you; it’s the
Germ you can’t live without.’ Could you
imagine life without a Ph.D., Roberta? If
you could, then the modern microbes are still
fighting their hardest for you, and the Love
Germ will get you yet if you don’t watch out.
But Betty is the ideal object for the attack of
the modern microbes, because she’s a little of
everything, except possibly clubs. Whereas,
the Society microbe wouldn’t look at you,
Roberta. It would run away at your approach.”</p>

<p>“Will you come up to Harding to-morrow?”
asked Roberta anxiously, ignoring the
aspersion upon her ability to be a society butterfly.</p>

<p>“This afternoon if you like,” Madeline returned,
as calmly as if she hadn’t been implored
by every mail for two weeks past to
come up and help with the reunion arrangements.</p>

<p>The B.C.A. party turned out a Merry
Hearts’ party. Roberta Lewis made a beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
Ph. D. microbe, with her hair “scrunched
back” under a mortar board, big spectacles,
and a manner copied from an astronomy
instructor who was universally known in
Harding circles as Miss Prunes and Prisms.
Roberta hadn’t acted since the senior play, she
said, but she was in splendid form nevertheless.
So was K., who, as the Pedagogic Microbe,
delivered a speech founded on her personal
experiences that brought down the house.</p>

<p>“You must each make up her own part,”
Madeline told the cast, when they met for the
first (and only) rehearsal. “I haven’t had
time to write out the speeches. Babbie, you
ought to know how to lobby for the society
act. You liked it pretty well that first winter
you were out of college. Eleanor, you’re in
love; well, explain the sensation. Babe, you
don’t act as if marriage was a failure; speak
up for it. Nita, you’re not a really energetic
club-woman, I’m happy to say, so here are
some few ideas to help you out. I shall speak
of a career from bitter experience. Betty, all
you have to do is to look thoughtful while we
talk, and scared while we fight for you. At
the end, when we decide to give you your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
choice, you are to explain that, since the
world is too full of a number of things,—namely
modern microbes,—the thing to do is
to shut your eyes and decide which one you
can’t live without. And until you’ve decided,
you propose to enjoy life all around. See? I’ll
write out your speech, if I can get time, because
it ought to be exactly right, to get the
best effect. Fire away now, Roberta.”</p>

<p>The rehearsal proceeded amid wild confusion.
Madeline coolly advised the cast to
improve their lines, reminded them encouragingly
that the costumes would help out wonderfully,
and departed, to compose a new
ploshkin song, while the supper committee, to
whom she had promised it weeks before,
waited patiently on her door-steps to seize and
carry it to the printer.</p>

<p>The B. C. A. party was sandwiched in between
a thunder-shower and the Glee Club’s
commencement concert. The stage was an
elm-shaded bank, the audience room as much
of the adjacent back-campus as would hold
19—, and a few stray specimens of its fiancés,
its husbands, and its babies. The “show”
was cheered to the echo, and the “eats” which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
followed, carefully selected from the Tally-ho’s
latest and most popular specialties, were voted
as good as the show.</p>

<p>“Of course,” the supper committee chanted,
besieging Madeline while she ate, “of course we
want it repeated with the class supper stunts.”</p>

<p>Madeline waved them away with a spoonful
of strawberry ice.</p>

<p>“Talk to the cast. This is one piece of
idiocy that I’m not responsible for. Oh, I
helped plan it, and I wrote the moral. That’s
positively all I did. Congratulate K. and
Roberta, not me. And have it again for class
supper if you really want it. Couldn’t we
run in the class animals for a sort of chorus—‘Beware
the Love Germ, 19—ers,’ and so on.
Ploshkins and Red Lions, and Jabberwocks
and Ritherums would make a lovely Moralizing
Chorus. Yes, I’ll write it, but I won’t
make wings for any more animals. I’ve decided
that I’m too old and too distinguished
to make any more animals’ wings.”</p>

<p>19—’s class supper was at the Tally-ho—of
course. T. Reed had brought little T. to the
reunion, and little T. had brought his big
ploshkin mascot to the supper. The undistinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
Mary Jones and her plain, frizzle-haired
little girl were there with the class
loving-cup. All the old cliques and crowds
were there, sitting as they used to sit, but
fused, by the esprit de corps that no class had
quite so strongly as 19—, into a big, splendid,
happy whole. Eleanor was toast-mistress
again. It was once toast-mistress, toast-mistress
forever, with 19—. Jean Eastman had a
speech called “Over the Wide, Wide World,”
all about wintering in Egypt and buying rugs
in Persia and yachting in the strange South
Seas. T. Reed had one on “Such is Life,” all
about raising babies and mushrooms and
woolly lambs on a ranch in Arizona. Nita’s
was called, on the menu-card, “Keep your
eye on the Ball,” and it was a funny muddle
of all the finest things that 19—ers had done
by everlasting keeping at it. Roberta’s degree
was one of the fine things, and Christy’s fellowship;
and Madeline’s play was the grand
climax, only Madeline spoiled the rhetorical
effect by calling out, “Nita, you know I
always do things by not keeping at them. I
hereby refuse to point your moral and adorn
your tale.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>In the midst of Nita’s speech Betty Wales
disappeared. The few girls who saw her go
thought that she was modestly trying to
escape hearing her praises sounded by Nita,
as one of the people 19— was proudest of.
Helen Adams, who had noticed Nora come
in and speak to Betty, thought that some
domestic crisis demanded her attention, and
hoped she wouldn’t have to stay in the kitchen
very long. For Helen had a speech herself
by and by, and she had planned to get
through it by looking right into Betty’s
intent, encouraging little face. But Betty
didn’t get back in time for Helen’s toast nor
for the two that came after it. The stunt-doers
were gathering in Flying Hoof’s stall to
put on their costumes, and the rest of the
girls were pushing back their chairs to face the
platform that Thomas the door-boy had built
in front of the fireplace, when Betty Wales
got back. She looked as if the domestic crisis
had been of a strenuous sort, but at last
happily terminated. Her face was flushed,
and her hair curled in little damp rings on
her forehead. But her expression was as
serene as possible, her eyes sparkled with fun,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
and her dimples just wouldn’t stay in, though
she tried to be duly serious over having lost
half the toasts—and half the supper too.</p>

<p>“But the stunts haven’t begun, have they?
Does ours come first? Did any engaged girls
run around the table that we don’t know
about already? Little Alice Waite! Oh, how
nice! Don’t begin our stunt just yet. I
want to speak to Madeline a minute. Oh,
well, never mind, if they’re all waiting.”</p>

<p>So the “College Girl and the Modern
Microbes, with a Moralizing Chorus of Class
Beasts,” went at once on the boards. Betty
Wales was no actress; not even her warmest
admirers had ever imagined that she possessed
histrionic ability, and it was only to satisfy a
whim of Madeline’s that she had taken what
she laughingly dubbed “a regular stick part”
in the Germ play. But at the class supper
performance she surprised everybody by her
vivacity. She informed the Ph. D. Germ
that she’d better take a course in doing her
hair becomingly. She mocked the Pedagogic
Germ with the hated epithet “Schoolma’am!
schoolma’am!” She caught the Love Germ
by an insecure white wing, and assured it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
that nobody fell in love with girls who were
just pinned together. All through the contest
of the Germs for her she kept interjecting
remarks in a disconcertingly unexpected
fashion. And at last the time came for the
moral. Betty hesitated just a minute, and
then began her one regular speech. She began
it just as usual, and she went on just as
usual until she came almost to the end: “So
the thing to do is to shut your eyes and
decide which one you can’t do without.” At
this point she shut her eyes for an impressive
moment. Then she opened them, and, with
a half-frightened, half-merry look at Madeline,
she walked up to the Love Germ and the
Wedding Bells Germ, and dragged them, one
on each side of her, to the front of the platform.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_334">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_334.jpg" alt="I’VE SHUT MY EYES AND I’VE CHOSEN">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“I’VE SHUT MY EYES AND I’VE CHOSEN”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“And so I’ve shut my eyes and I’ve chosen,
and—please everybody congratulate me quick!
Eleanor Watson first, please, Eleanor dear.”</p>

<p>Betty Wales ran down from the platform,
still dragging the winning Germs after her,
and followed by a riotous mob of other Germs
and Class Animals, which was speedily joined
by another mob of all the finest class of 19—.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>There were no more stunts that night. When
the supper committee stopped trying to get a
chance to congratulate Betty and hear how it
all happened, why, by that time it was much
too late for stunts. It was time—and long
past time—for the class march to the other
suppers, to return serenades and congratulations,
and then to visit “Every Loved Spot on
the Whole Blessed Campus,” as the new ploshkin
song put it, and to sing the ploshkin song
and the other reunion favorites until everybody
was hoarse enough and tired enough to be
ready to stop reunioning—and that meant
extra-specially hoarse and extra-specially tired;
and time in plenty was needed for its accomplishment.</p>

<p>When it was all over, nobody knew anything
about Betty’s engagement, except that it was
to Jim Watson.</p>

<p>“I was out of the room when they ran
around the table,” she had explained over and
over. “So I just spoiled Madeline’s lovely
moral to tell you. But she says she doesn’t
mind, and I wanted you all to know, while
we’re here together, how blissfully happy I
am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>“After the rest are out of the way the Merry
Hearts will meet in the Peter Pan Annex, top
story.” So the word went round, when 19—
was finally ready to disperse. “The fifteeners
went to bed ages ago, so it’s empty. We don’t
want to go to bed.”</p>

<p>“I should say not,” each Merry Heart acknowledged
the news of the rendezvous. “We
want to hear all about Betty Wales.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jim came up to-night unexpectedly.
Where is he now? In bed, I certainly hope,”
said Betty Wales. “Ye-es, he’d asked me
before, but he never asked me—hard enough.
And then Madeline’s rule—whether or not you
can live without a person—or a thing—is ever
so much easier to apply when you’re maybe
going to lose the person for a long, long
time.”</p>

<p>“And were you going to lose Jimmie for a
long time?” inquired Eleanor, who didn’t
know any more than the rest how the great
desire of her heart—second only to her plans
for her own and Dick’s happiness—had suddenly
become a reality.</p>

<p>Betty nodded proudly. “He’s got a splendid
big commission. It’s to build a town—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
whole nice little new town—factories, schools,
houses, everything, at a mine and a water
power that Mr. O’Toole owns. First he’s got
to go to Germany to work up some plans for
it. It will all take several years. And I saw
that I couldn’t get along without——”</p>

<p>“Stop! That’s a very dangerous moral,”
cut in Madeline hastily. “Don’t keep repeating
it around here, or somebody else may be
infected with the Love Germ.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” agreed Betty gaily, “then I
won’t say over the dangerous moral. But—the
town he has to build is thirty miles from
a railroad that hasn’t been built. I mean—the
town isn’t there yet either. And it will
be on a railroad by and by, but it isn’t now.
Wouldn’t it be losing Jim pretty hard to have
him away off there without me?”</p>

<p>“How about the Coach and Six?” demanded
Madeline severely.</p>

<p>Betty went on smiling her happy little
smile. “I’ll have to start it off somehow
before I go. Mr. Morton will understand.
He likes Jim. Oh, and when I’m gone there
will be a place for Straight. So the twins are
settled, and that’s one thing off my mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>“Who’ll undertake Montana Marie
O’Toole?” demanded Madeline inexorably.
“She isn’t a thing that you can start off and
then leave to go on by herself in proper
style.”</p>

<p>Betty laughed. “I don’t know about that.
It’s Mr. O’Toole who has commissioned Jim,
on Marie’s recommendation, to build the town.
So she’s really responsible about Jim and me.
I’m going to tell her to-morrow that, since
she can plan things so well for other people,
it’s time she managed her own affairs better.
That is, of course I shall speak to her mother
for her, because I promised to. Oh, dear, we
can’t discuss that, because no one is supposed
to know about it yet. But my freshman is all
right, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you think the Tally-ho and
Morton Hall and the Student’s Aid and small
Dorothy can get along without you,” continued
Madeline, who was going to miss Betty dreadfully,
and was teasing her to avoid showing
her real feelings.</p>

<p>“Of course!” Nothing could daunt Betty
Wales to-night. “Anything can get along
without anybody—except—Jim and me. Besides,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
I shall have time to see to all those
things before I’m—married. I don’t know
when Jim is going to Germany. I only saw
him for a little minute——”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried her friends, remembering how
many toasts she had missed.</p>

<p>“Well, we didn’t get to anything practical
like time,” Betty defended herself. “But if
he has to go too soon, why, we can’t be married
till he gets home. It takes ages to get ready
to be married, doesn’t it?” She looked from
one to another of the prospective brides, each
of whom nodded solemnly. Betty sighed.
“I never thought of that. Jim just said that
the trip to Germany would be a nice honeymoon.
I wonder how soon he has to start.
Girls, I really must go to bed. I want to be
up early to-morrow morning to talk it all
over.”</p>

<p>“With us?” demanded Madeline.</p>

<p>“No, human question-point,” Betty told
her severely. “With Jim.”</p>

<small>THE END OF BETTY WALES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Wait</span> till I get home from Germany!”
repeated Jim, when he had explained that he
was sailing in ten days, and Betty had explained
that getting ready to be married takes
ages and ages. “Never mind a trousseau!
Never mind a linen chest! Never mind even
a wedding dress! Let’s just be married.
That’s the best way, I think, no matter how
much time you’ve got. We can run over to
Paris—we shall probably have to anyway—and
you can shop there while I work. You
can do anything you like all the rest of your
life, if you’ll only marry me some day next
week. Honestly now, Betty, do you care
about the fuss of weddings?”</p>

<p>“N-o,” confessed Betty hesitatingly. “I
guess not. I’m rather tired just now of all
kinds of fuss and complications and crowds.”</p>

<p>“Then will you marry me some day next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
week?” asked Jim again with his broadest,
most persuasive smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will,” said Betty Wales, and that
matter was definitely settled.</p>

<p>“I think ends are frightful,” Betty confided
to Madeline, who was helping her pack up on
the day after commencement. “I’m glad I’ve
got to hurry, because it will soon be over—the
end of Betty Wales. Ends are frightful, because
you have to finish everything up just
so. No more chances to try again, or smooth
things over, or change to something else.
And a messy person like me has so many
silly little odds and ends to attend to.”</p>

<p>“Such as?” queried Madeline, absently
packing a brass candlestick on top of Betty’s
best hat.</p>

<p>Betty rescued the hat skilfully. “Since
I’m not going to have any bride things to
speak of I must save what I’ve got,” she explained.
“Oh, odds and ends like seeing that
the shy, homely girls on the summer employment
list get positions right away, because the
new secretary mightn’t think they were good
for much; and seeing that Emily Davis isn’t
putting herself out too much by staying on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
for a while to coach Georgia; and trimming
Nora’s little niece’s hat, as I’ve done every
summer, until she’s gotten to depend on it;
and saying good-bye to the Stocking Factory
people that I know best; and—oh, dozens of
silly little things like those.”</p>

<p>“Incidentally you’ve got to decide on a
wedding day, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Betty easily. “That is, I
wrote to Mother to choose any day she preferred
the week after Babbie’s. I’m too busy
to think, and the day really doesn’t matter.
It’s going to be at our Lakeside cottage,
you know,—on the big back piazza, I guess,
because that’s the prettiest, biggest room in
the house.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later a maid brought a telegram
to Betty: “Lakeside cottage burned
down last night. How about that impromptu
wedding? Will Wales.”</p>

<p>“Gracious, what a mess!” exclaimed Betty,
and looked very sober for at least three minutes.
Then she smiled again. “I’m glad
that the cottage burned down now, if it had to
burn at all. Lakeside is so dreadfully sandy,
and now that we haven’t any house at all, I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
just as well be married in the very place that
I’ve always wanted to go to a wedding in.
I can stay here quietly with Dorothy, except
when I rush off to Babbie’s, and Nan can
come up from Boston a lot easier than she can
go to Cleveland, and Mother and Father and
Will can come here as well as not. They’ve
never seen the Tally-ho, and they ought to,
before it stops being a little speck mine. And
so I can be married in that little glade in
Paradise—the one that widens out from the
narrow path that looks like an aisle.”</p>

<p>“How lovely!” cried Madeline eagerly.
“I should think that was nicer than any cottage!
And the bridal party and the guests
can go in boats—so much more romantic
than carriages or motor-cars.”</p>

<p>“And the wedding feast can be a picnic,”
laughed Betty. “Bob will be extra-specially
delighted with that idea.”</p>

<p>“And the music——” began Madeline,
when the maid interrupted again. This time
it was callers.</p>

<p>“A lady and a gentleman,” Maggie explained.
“They didn’t give no names.”</p>

<p>“The tribe of O’Toole,” Madeline guessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
gaily, “come to reproach you for your prospective
abandonment of their offspring, and
for having let Straight Dutton give her that
dreadful dictionary of slang. Her conversation
is a mass of quotations from it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, I hope they won’t be cross about
anything,” sighed Betty, starting for the door.</p>

<p>“If they are, call me. I’ll finish them in
short order,” Madeline promised savagely.</p>

<p>Betty was gone a long time, but she did not
send for Madeline, who, forgetting that the
new wedding arrangement would defer packing,
continued to pile candlesticks upon hats
and to stuff Betty’s fresh shirt-waists into her
chafing-dish and her copper teakettle, to save
room. Finally a lazy mood fell upon her, and
she curled up on Betty’s cushioned window-seat,
to think about the picnic-wedding—how
she would trim the bride’s boat, and what
would be the very nicest “eats” for a wedding
feast in a wood. It was to be a Wedding
Feast, with capitals, Madeline decided; calling
it a picnic took away the novelty and the
dignity of the occasion.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” began Betty Wales,
breaking excitedly into Madeline’s meditations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
“What do you think has happened
now, Madeline Ayres?”</p>

<p>“Paradise hasn’t burned up too, has it?”
asked Madeline lazily. “Because I’m planning
the loveliest features for a Paradise wedding.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly, Madeline.” Betty ungratefully
ignored the promised features.</p>

<p>“Well, have the O’Tooles persuaded you
that it’s a fatal mistake for you to abandon
Montana Marie?”</p>

<p>“Please don’t be silly,” Betty reiterated.
“It’s nothing about the wedding or about me.
It’s about Harding. Mr. O’Toole is just splendid,
Madeline. He’s quick-tempered and
short-spoken like Mr. Morton, but he’s awfully
nice. And he’s going to give Harding—well,
it’s not decided what, but something perfectly
splendid.”</p>

<p>“Oh, was that why President Wallace was
so interested in your freshman?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” said Betty, with much
dignity. “But I know now why President
Wallace was so anxious to have her get
through successfully. You know there was a
lot of trouble about her entering Harding, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
Mrs. O’Toole kept on insisting, because she
hates to have Marie disappointed in anything.
She had always bought things for her before,
so she tried to buy her a chance to enter Harding
without entrance conditions or any worries
of that kind. Of course President Wallace
refused, but he was sorry for Marie and he let
her in, as he sometimes has other exceptional
girls, on condition that she should keep her
work strictly up to the standard. Then he
was naturally anxious for her to succeed, both
for her own sake and to show her mother that
honest work and not money are the requirements
of this college. Mr. O’Toole understood
all that. He was dreadfully annoyed when
he heard what his wife had done. He says if
he had been President Wallace he’d have just
‘sent those fool women-folk flying.’ He
thinks President Wallace has done a lot for
Marie, and now he wants to ‘square up,’ as he
calls it. He wants me to suggest what Harding
needs, and to explain to President Wallace
that this gift is entirely different from
Mrs. O’Toole’s offer. That won’t be hard, since
Marie is going to leave.”</p>

<p>“Is she?” cried Madeline, making a wry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
face. “Just as I’d definitely decided to use
her for the heroine of my next novel!”</p>

<p>“Mrs. O’Toole has decided that she cares less
about a title in the family than about Marie’s
being happy, and as Marie never had any
trouble in deciding what she couldn’t live
without, she’s going to marry a nice man from
Montana just as soon as she can get ready.
Next fall, I suppose that will be.”</p>

<p>“She’s been rather amusing,” reflected
Madeline, “if she has bothered a lot at
times.”</p>

<p>Betty stared, wide-eyed, at this wrong-headed
view of things. “She never meant to bother.
And she was the one who made me decide
about Jim.”</p>

<p>Madeline laughed gleefully. “I wondered
how long you’d keep on talking as if splendid
gifts to Harding College were your chief interest
in life, Betty Wales. By the way, speaking
of tea-shops, has Mr. Morton answered your
letter?”</p>

<p>“He telegraphed,” Betty explained. “He
just said, ‘He’s a nice boy, Miss B. A., and
you can manage him, so I wish you much joy.’
Not a word about the Coach and Six. I hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
he isn’t hurt at my backing out. Do you
think he can be, Madeline?”</p>

<p>For answer Madeline picked her small friend
up and tucked her in among the cushions of
the window-seat. “You are not to worry
about people’s feeling hurt,” she ordered.
“People will feel sorry, of course—foolish
people like me. I have an idea that I’m
going to miss you fearfully, Betty Wales. A
career is an awfully lonely thing, the week
your very best little pal is getting married.
But you’ve always been true to your title.
You’ve been Miss B. A. to Mr. Morton and to
every single other soul you’ve ever had anything
to do with. That’s why we’re bound
not to lose you now, for all of Jim.”</p>

<p>“You dear old Madeline! As if Jim or I
wanted to lose our dearest friends! Now tell
me about the wedding-with-features, so I can
write it all to Mother, and then she won’t
mind so much about the cottage. And help
me think of some splendid gifts to suggest to
President Wallace, so I can see him to-day,
and then write to Mr. O’Toole that it’s all
arranged. And help me to try on my bridesmaid’s
dress for Babbie’s wedding, to be sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
if it fits. See how I can’t get along without
you, you dear silly Madeline!”</p>

<p>“That’s one way to say it,” Madeline told
her, “but the truth is—— Oh, stop me,
somebody! If I get to sentimentalizing over
the happy past I shall weep, and with a rapid
succession of festal occasions looming before
me I can’t spare a handkerchief so early in
the game.”</p>

<p>The day of the Paradise wedding-with-features
was a made-to-order feature in itself.
The sun sparkled on the water. A tricksy
little wind rippled the waves, and ruffled the
leaves of Paradise wood. In the deep, still
glades the thrushes sang like mad. The
bride’s boat, from edge to water-line, was a
mass of fine white “bridal wreath” blossoms.
The groom’s boat was decked with laurel.
The guests sat among daisy-wreaths. Somewhere
in the wood human musicians were
hidden, and their notes came faint and far and
fairylike in the pauses of the thrushes’ concert.
Betty’s soft white dress didn’t, as K.
said, look a bit “wedding-i-fied.” She looked
like a sweet spring flower, against the shadowy
green of the wedding aisle, down which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
came with her father, the Smallest Sister
leading the way, proud and anxious and much
excited, in her capacity of solitary attendant.
There were no bridesmaids, because Betty
hadn’t been able to choose among the Merry
Hearts.</p>

<p>“And if I have them all,” she said, “why,
there’ll be more bridesmaids than wedding
guests.”</p>

<p>Madeline had superintended the roping-off
of the chosen glade with daisy-chains, and
bunches of daises tied to the branches of the
trees at one end made a blossomy background
for the bridal party to stand against.</p>

<p>“Oh, it takes such a little minute to be
married!” cried Betty Wales in an awestruck
voice, when it was over.</p>

<p>“It’s going to take time to eat the Wedding
Feast,” Madeline announced, and led the way
down a little side-path to the water’s edge.
There the Wedding Feast was spread on a long
table, lovely with ferns and more daisies.
Bridget and Nora were in charge, but under
them worked a small army of water-nymphs,
dryads, elves, and woodland fairies, who
seated the guests and then served them, giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
odd, fairy names to prosaic dishes, and
pausing in their labors to dance, sing, and
chant the Lay of the Woodland Wedding,
which Madeline and Helen Adams had sat up
the whole night before Babbie’s wedding to
compose, as an engagement present for Betty
Wales. The nymphs, elves, and fairies were
professors’ small sons and daughters, not yet
off on their vacations, and Stocking Factory
children from the other hill—all as merry and
companionable together as possible. Mary
Brooks Hinsdale and Emily Davis had dressed
them, according to Madeline’s orders. Georgia
Ames had taught them the songs and the
Woodland Wedding Lay, and Bob, who had
learned a lot of folk-dances at a New York
settlement, came up two days early to contribute
her share to the Loveliest Wedding.</p>

<p>That was what Mary christened it, as the
wedding party took ship again; and Mary’s
names always stuck.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is, of course,” agreed Babbie, a little
wistfully. She and Mr. Thayer had planned
their journeyings to include Betty’s wedding.
“And the most impromptu. It makes even
yours seem quite cold and formal, Mary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>“For once,” put in Bob placidly, “I’ve
eaten as much wedding cake as I wanted.
Picnics are the only time you can eat all you
want, you know, and still be a perfect lady.
That’s why I particularly adore them.”</p>

<p>Up at Morton Hall Jasper J. Morton, who
had come to the wedding with Babe and John,
was berating them both roundly because he
had forgotten most of his present for Betty—the
part he had remembered was merely a
wonderful old silver tea-service fit for a
princess.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it’s no matter,” he acknowledged
at last. “Nothing to boil over at, Miss B. A.
It’s very easy to describe the missing articles—a
deed to the Coach and Six and to my
share in the Tally-ho. Conditioned on your
dining with me once every time you come to
New York to look after your properties.”</p>

<p>Betty gasped. “Oh, Mr. Morton, you
shouldn’t give me anything more. It isn’t
right to give two—three wedding presents.
Such splendid ones, too!”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton smiled at her fondly. “You’ve
given me lots of presents, Miss B. A.,—a kind
friend, a keen critic, a cure-all for bad temper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
and impatience, and a teacher of all the fun
there is in life, the real fun that doesn’t depend
on ‘doing’ the other fellow in business.
Besides, Miss B. A., about that tea-shop now.
I’m a selfish old man. I don’t want a tea-shop,
and I do want to hang on to you. I’m
interested in your business theories.” He
chuckled. “I want you to keep on discovering
’em. I’m glad you’re Mrs. Jim Watson”—Betty
jumped at the strange new
name—“but I’ll wager young Watson here
doesn’t want you to settle down into just Mrs.
Jim. It’ll do you good to have a tea-shop to
think about sometimes. Not to worry about,
mind you; the Coach and Six is on a sound
business basis. And remember, Miss B. A.,
there’s one thing I haven’t changed about. I
always did perfectly hate to be thanked.”</p>

<p>“Then I shan’t try,” laughed Betty. “And
I shan’t let you off one of those dinners. I
shall love having the tea-shops. It makes me
feel less as if this was the end of Betty Wales—less
as if I’d been blown out to make room
for Mrs. Jim.” Betty made a funny little face
at Jim, who retorted with, “Haven’t forgotten
that train, have you, Mrs. Jim?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>When the carriage came for them, the elves
and wood fairies surrounded it and pelted the
bridal couple with armfuls of daisies instead
of rice and old shoes. So it was through a
rain of daisies that Betty caught her last
glimpse of the Merry Hearts, who stood in a
little group by themselves waving her off.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Betty Wales.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Mrs. Jim.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div>

<p>The carriage had rounded the curve in the
road, but the Merry Hearts still stared after it
in rather somber silence.</p>

<p>“Just the same——” Madeline broke the
pause disconsolately. “Just the same, it is
the end of Betty Wales.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Eleanor chokingly.</p>

<p>“Certainly it is,” put in Mary Brooks decisively
“And high time, in my opinion.
Do you want her to wear herself out doing
things for other people, with nobody whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
special business it is to do things for her?
Do you want her to miss any of the good
things life has for her? I say, hurrah for
Montana Marie O’Toole, who helped Betty
decide on Jim.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Mrs. Hinsdale,” broke in
Mr. Morton excitedly. “I’ve been doing my
best for some time, but I guess I’m a poor
hand at matchmaking. Anyhow it took the
young lady from Montana to pull this affair
off.”</p>

<p>“Things were so nice as they were,” mourned
Madeline.</p>

<p>“They’re terribly nice as they are, I think,”
said little Helen Adams eagerly.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for the end of Betty Wales!”
cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Betty Wales herself!” put in
Madeline.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Mrs. Jim!” shouted all the
Merry Hearts together, so loudly that Betty
and Jim, who had stopped the carriage just
around the curve to shake off the daisies,
heard it and smiled appreciatively at each
other.</p>

<p>“And for Mr. Jim!” went on the chorus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
impartially. “And for their married life!”
it ended, to round out the subject.</p>

<p>Betty snuggled closer to Jim. “It’s all
been lovely, and I shall like having the tea-shops
to remind me of old times, but I like
most extra-specially much being just Mrs.
Jim.”</p>

<p>“And I like more extra-specially than I
can say having you for Mrs. Jim,” her husband
told her.</p>

<p>“Then everything is extra-specially all
right, isn’t it?” said Betty Wales Watson,
with a happy little smile.</p>
